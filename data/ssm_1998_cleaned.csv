1085,1998-06-22,SUPERANNUATION (ENTITLEMENTS OF SAME SEX COUPLES) BILL 1998,First Reading,Anthony Albanese,1,ALP,Grayndler,1," However, if superannuation is to play a role in the government's retirement income policy, then all people who contribute should have equal access to their super upon retirement. At present, this is not the case. There is a significant group of wage and salary earners in Australia who have little incentive to contribute to a super scheme because their spouses do not have access to superannuation benefits upon their death. As the legislation currently stands, gay and lesbian couples are clearly discriminated against. The explanatory memorandum to this bill outlines that this discrimination includes: .	 On retirement of the contributor, refusal to pay a joint pension for the contributor and his or her same sex partner; .	 On retirement of the contributor, refusal to pay a lump sum benefit in respect of a same sex partner; .	 On the death of the contributor, refusal to pay death benefits to a same sex partner, either by reversionary pension or lump sum benefit; On the death of the contributor, failure to investigate or acknowledge the claim to dependency of a child of a same sex couple when the contributor is not the biological parent of the child; and .	 On the death of the contributor, payment of death benefits to the estate of the contributor rather than to the same sex partner as a dependant. This bill is an important step forward for those thousands of couples around Australia who are currently discriminated against by superannuation fund trustees on the basis of their sexual preference. I can assure members that this is not just an issue relevant to my inner city Sydney electorate. In every corner of Australia, gay and lesbian couples are quietly going on with their lives, working and caring for their families. It is important to stress that this is not about introducing some kind of special rights for gay and lesbian couples. This is about equal rights-rights that every other Australian worker living in a domestic relationship with someone they love would be perfectly entitled to expect. This legislation allows a gay or lesbian worker to properly provide for their surviving partner and children in the event of their death-something which is a perfectly reasonable expectation for any couple. Last week I had the pleasure of speaking at a very well attended rally organised by the New South Wales Gay and Lesbian Rights lobby outside State Parliament House. In spite of the torrential rain and cold, thousands of people came onto the streets to demonstrate in favour of equal rights for gay and lesbian communities. Those protesters were not asking for special treatment; they were asking for equal treatment. An article in today's Sydney Morning Herald details how British MPs are likely to vote overwhelmingly today in favour of equalising the age of consent in Britain. The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has said: This is an issue of equality, and because it concerns the equal rights of our citizens, this is an issue not just for those who are gay but for all of us who are concerned about the type of society in which we live. I concur with those remarks. I urge all members of this House to consider those words carefully. This legislation does not aim to give additional allowances to gay and lesbian couples, but it does aim to place them in an equal position with all other Australian workers and their partners. I strongly urge all members of this House, whether they be on the government side, on the opposition side or on the crossbenches, to examine their consciences, to support this bill and to support equal rights at the workplace with respect to superannuation benefits. I seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum. Leave granted. Bill read a first time."
1606,1998-12-07,SUPERANNUATION (ENTITLEMENTS OF SAME SEX COUPLES) BILL 1998,First Reading,Anthony Albanese,1,ALP,Grayndler,1," Both the ALP and the coalition in government have endeavoured to ensure that all individual workers and employers now contribute to superannuation schemes. Superannuation is becoming an increasingly important part of many employees' salary packages. Not only is this good retirement incomes policy but it is good policy for Australia's national savings as well. Currently, however, gay and lesbian workers and their families are not receiving the same benefits from their superannuation contributions as other workers. Couples of the same sex in a relationship-and one that would be considered a de facto relationship if the partners were of opposite sexes-currently do not enjoy the same superannuation benefits as heterosexual couples, while making identical superannuation contributions. The discrimination against these couples occurs in the following areas: .	 on retirement of the contributor, refusal to pay a joint pension for the contributor and his or her same sex partner; .	 on retirement of the contributor, refusal to pay a lump sum benefit in respect of a same sex partner; .	 on the death of the contributor, refusal to pay death benefits to a same sex partner, either by reversionary pension or lump sum benefit; .	 on the death of the contributor, failure to investigate or acknowledge the claim to dependency of a child of a same sex couple when the contributor is not the biological parent of the child; and .	 on the death of the contributor, payment of death benefits to the estate of the contributor rather than to the same sex partner as a dependant. This discrimination is inconsistent with other Commonwealth and state legislation and international undertakings, and needs to be addressed as an issue of equity for Australian workers. Allow me to put a human face to this problem. While in Melbourne meeting with the Victorian gay and lesbian rights lobby recently, I spoke with a gentleman by the name of Greg Brown. Greg and his partner, Robert Corva, had been in a relationship for over 10 years when Robert died in 1993. At that time, Robert had been employed by the Department of Defence for 17 years and was a contributor to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. After Robert's death, Greg was unable to gain access to his partner's superannuation entitlements. The case went to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 1995, which found that although amendments to the Superannuation Act in 1992 had removed discrimination on the grounds of marital status, this did not apply to same sex couples. Greg pursued the case to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which last month handed down its decision. The commissioner, Chris Sidoti, in declining Greg's complaint found that, while Greg had been treated unequally, the discrimination was legal under current legislation. However, to his credit, Commissioner Sidoti has undertaken to examine the Superannuation Act in relation to its effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity in employment or occupation. I look forward to such an inquiry being carried out and urge HREOC to undertake it as soon as practicable. Unfortunately, any inquiry will come too late for Mr Brown who has now pursued action as far as he is able to under the current law. It is tragic that people still grieving for their loved ones are having to take on battles such as this in order just to achieve equal treatment. I originally introduced this legislation after two years of unsuccessfully lobbying the government to introduce amendments to the act. On 25 May 1998, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Chris Miles-the former member for Braddon-wrote to me and stated that the government is not inclined to amend the superannuation legislation at this time. The former member for Braddon has gone but the discrimination stays. This case once again highlights the urgent need for reform and why the government must take action. In closing, I would like to emphasise to members that this is not an issue about special rights for any particular group of workers; it is about equal rights for all. I am pleased that it will be seconded by the member for Melbourne Ports, who is committed to achieving results on this issue. I urge all members of this House to support this bill in the strongest possible terms because it is about equity and justice for all, and the current discrimination should not be tolerated in Australian society in 1998. I seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum."
