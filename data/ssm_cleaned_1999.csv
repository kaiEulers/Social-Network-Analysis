2550,1999-06-07,SUPERANNUATION (ENTITLEMENTS OF SAME SEX COUPLES) BILL 1998,Second Reading,Anthony Albanese,1,ALP,Grayndler,1," That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, I first raised the issue of equal superannuation rights for same sex partners on 10 December 1996, during an adjournment speech. I am pleased to have this opportunity today, thanks to the support of the Chief Opposition Whip, the member for Watson, to give the second reading speech on my private member's bill, the Superannuation (Entitlements of Same Sex Couples) Bill 1998. I of course would prefer a full debate and vote on this issue but that is something some in the government seem determined to prevent. A full debate would have given supporters, such as the member for Melbourne Ports, who is the seconder to this bill and campaigned very hard for its success, a chance to make a contribution to the debate. It would also have allowed the member for Bradfield, who is here today and who has indicated his support-and indeed, the member for Parramatta-to make a contribution to this debate so that we could examine this issue. But that will have to wait for another day. In my adjournment speech in 1996, I was shocked, as I am now, that a country such as ours, which prides itself on principles of equality and `a fair go for all', still possessed legislation that contravened basic human rights. When I first raised the issue of equal superannuation rights for same sex couples, some members of this House thought this was an obscure issue. Of course, an injustice to any individual-or a section of society-is an injustice which undermines the equity in that society as a whole. The campaign to end discrimination has gathered substantial momentum. There has been sustained lobbying from individuals, community organisations, trade unions, The Body Shop and the superannuation industry. Today, I am finally able to give the second reading speech to this private member's bill, the Superannuation (Entitlements of Same Sex Couples) Bill 1998. It has been a long time coming, but that does not mean that it is not important. It is important because of the importance of superannuation both to individuals and to national savings. The Keating Labor government introduced massive reforms to the superannuation sector, providing many Australians with access to superannuation for the first time. The Labor government put in place measures that ensured minimum employer contributions for all Australian wage and salary earners. These initiatives mean that more than 93 percent of full-time employees, 67 percent of part-time employees and 59 percent of casual employees are now covered by superannuation. The success of these initiatives makes it even more important that the fruits of universal superannuation are exactly that-universal. I have argued throughout this debate that my bill is not about introducing special rights for gay and lesbian couples. It is about introducing equal rights, rights that every other Australian worker would be perfectly entitled to expect. This private member's bill allows for a gay or lesbian worker to properly provide for their surviving partner and children in the event of their death, which is a perfectly reasonable expectation for any couple. As the legislation currently stands, gay and lesbian couples are clearly discriminated against. The explanatory memorandum to this bill outlines that this discrimination includes: on retirement of the contributor, refusal to pay a joint pension for the contributor and his or her same sex partner; .	 on retirement of the contributor, refusal to pay a lump sum benefit in respect of a same sex partner; .	 on the death of the contributor, refusal to pay death benefits to a same sex partner, either by reversionary pension or lump sum benefit; .	 on the death of the contributor, failure to investigate or acknowledge the claim to dependency of a child of a same sex couple when the contributor is not the biological parent of the child; and .	 on the death of the contributor, payment of death benefits to the estate of the contributor rather than to the same sex partner as a dependant. Current superannuation legislation allows only two possible ways in which a same sex partner can access their partner's superannuation. The first possible way is if the partner can prove financial dependence. It is not necessary to prove financial dependence if you are in a heterosexual relationship. The access to your partner's superannuation is accepted regardless of your own financial position. Therefore, people in same sex relationships are discriminated against if both partners are working and contributing to the nation's economy by earning their own living. The other way that death benefits can be accessed is if the partner is named the sole beneficiary in the member's will. The estate can then be named as a death benefit nominee. However, apart from limited access to what should be a right, this also presents a number of problems. Instead of easily accessing the payment, the surviving partner may have to wait for probate, and the payment is therefore likely to be taxed at a rate of up to 21.5 percent instead of being mostly tax free. Furthermore, the beneficiary will have to stand in line behind any creditors to the estate. I want to give the parliament an example that is very real and very tragic-the example of Greg Brown. Greg and his partner, Robert Corva, had been in a relationship for over 10 years when Robert passed away in 1993. Mr Corva had been employed by the Department of Defence for 17 years and had therefore contributed to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. After Mr Corva died, Mr Brown was unable to access his partner's superannuation funds. But he was a fighter, so he took up the challenge. The case went to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 1995, which found: There is no doubt that the applicant and Mr Corva had a close marriage like relationship and that they conformed to the requirements of section 8A in all respects except for their gender. Yet the 1992 amendments, which were designed to remove discrimination on the ground of marital status, provide no redress in relation to the form of discrimination which is illustrated by this case. In other words, despite the 1992 amendments which removed discrimination on the grounds of marital status, discrimination for same sex couples still applied. Greg Brown did not stop there. He took his case to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which handed down its decision in November of last year. The commissioner, Chris Sidoti, in declining Greg's complaint found that, while Greg had suffered from discrimination, this discrimination was legal under current legislation. Just think about that for a moment. Imagine taking a case to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in Australia in the late 1990s and being told, `Yes, you're being discriminated against, but it's legal discrimi nation.' Surely this House should not find that situation acceptable. Commissioner Sidoti undertook to examine the Superannuation Act in relation to its effect on nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity in employment or occupation. That report, entitled Superannuation entitlements of same sex couples, was tabled in this House last Thursday having been forwarded to the Attorney-General in April. The report considered the Superannuation Act 1976, the Defence Force Retirements and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991. Commissioner Sidoti found: In denying to surviving same sex partners of superannuation fund members an entitlement to benefit, these acts contravene the prohibitions on sexual preference discrimination in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Labour Organisation Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention (ILO 111), both of which are scheduled to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 . This report represents a thorough examination of the issues involved. It makes clear that this discrimination is not intentional but derives from the narrow definition of `spouse'. Indeed, when in 1992 the minister gave his second reading speech to amend the Superannuation Act 1976, he stated that the `key criterion for eligibility of a surviving spouse . . . will be the existence of a permanent and bona fide relationship'. There was no discussion at this time about whether it was intended to exclude same sex couples. Ignorance is no longer an excuse. The need for reform has been made all too clear. All that is required is political will on behalf of this parliament. Commissioner Sidoti recommended that legislation be amended to allow surviving same sex partners to benefit in Commonwealth superannuation schemes. Indeed, the report recommends that amendments be made to the Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment) Repeal and Amendment Bill 1998, a bill currently before the Senate, to ensure that the enactments arising from the legislation are consistent with human rights. This report exposes the political nature of opposition to my bill. As I stated earlier, my first pursuit of reform was to encourage the government to amend the legislation. I raised the issue in parliament and wrote to the Prime Minister seeking support. On 25 May 1998, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and leading Lyons Forum member, Mr Chris Miles, replied on behalf of the Prime Minister. He stated: the government is not inclined to amend the superannuation and taxation legislation at this time to recognise same sex partners as dependants and spouses for the purpose of superannuation death benefits. He continued: I note that, under the current law, same sex partners would be a dependant if they are financially dependent on their deceased partner. Surely the HREOC report must tell the government how wrong they are and how much reform is needed. Since I introduced this bill we have seen a groundswell of community support for law reform. The issue of recognition of same sex relationships has received coverage on programs as diverse as the ABC's World Today and Mike Gibson's morning radio show on Sydney radio station 2GB. The Australian Financial Review columnist Christopher Pearson, not known for his radical or Labor-supporting views, wrote a column about my bill on 3 May. He noted the inadequacies of the government's superannuation legislation amendment bill in addressing the problem, stating: The federal government has recently introduced a stop-gap measure. In future super funds will be able to accept `binding death benefit nominations'. In practice this will mean that a fund member can nominate his or her estate as beneficiary and provide for a surviving partner in the will. It doesn't mean nominating the partner directly because the act's anachronistic definition of a `dependant' remains unchanged. Another unsatisfactory aspect of this piecemeal reform is that death benefits transferred via the contributor's estate seem likely to attract different tax treatment. If you do not accept what I have to say about the need for reform, listen to Christopher Pearson, listen to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, listen to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia. All of them support recognition of same sex relationships in superannuation legislation. The community outrage at the discrimination currently suffered by people in same sex relationships has recently seen The Body Shop join the campaign. The Body Shop distributed information and collected signatures on petitions calling for my bill to be debated and put to a vote. The Body Shop campaign attracted the support of a range of community organisations, including the Australian Education Union, the ALSO Foundation, People Living with HIV/AIDS (Victoria) and the Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby in Victoria and New South Wales. The launches of The Body Shop campaign in Sydney and Melbourne, which were organised by the member for Melbourne Ports, were attended by coalition MPs in both places. The information distributed by The Body Shop stated: Why is The Body Shop involved? Our mission statement reads: To passionately campaign for the protection of human and civil rights. We believe that current laws discriminate against same sex couples and that it is important for politicians to address this issue now! Not because we have a `gay and lesbian agenda', as some would accuse, but because equality in the law for all Australians is significant to all Australians. The Body Shop hit the nail right on the head. This is not about a gay and lesbian agenda, it is not about special rights and it is not about gay marriage; it is just about treating people fairly and equally. It is about an economic level playing field, which those people who believe in the free market should understand. How can we be serious about encouraging savings and self-funded retirement when the current legislation discourages a significant section of the working population from placing their funds in superannuation? It has taken me 2 years to get to this point today, delivering the second reading speech for this bill. I hope that this bill will receive unanimous support and end superannuation discrimination. I am able to give this speech because of the overwhelming support this bill has received from community groups, unions and principled private sector organisations such as The Body Shop. These groups maintained the campaign for reform as the govern ment continued to prevaricate, to delay and to suggest that there was no need for legislative change. However, 2 years of waiting is nothing compared to the waiting and the heartache that many in the gay and lesbian community have been forced to undergo whilst dealing with the inequities of our current superannuation system. These men and women have had to take up lengthy and costly legal battles at a time when they should be allowed to grieve in private, at a time which should be a time of respect. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the courage of people such as Greg Brown. Greg continues to pursue change even though he will not be a beneficiary himself. He said to me after The Body Shop campaign launch in Melbourne that he did not want anyone else to go through his pain. This is an issue of human rights. Equal rights, regardless of sexuality, is as fundamental a human right as equal rights regardless of class, gender or ethnicity. It is vital that the government show the same bipartisan support as we recently saw in New South Wales, where the New South Wales Legislative Assembly carried, without dissent, support for same sex rights. I encourage support for this bill, and I seek leave to table the replacement explanatory memorandum."
3841,1999-11-22,SUPERANNUATION (ENTITLEMENTS OF SAME SEX COUPLES) BILL 1999,First Reading,Anthony Albanese,1,ALP,Grayndler,1," I have spoken in this House about equality for same sex couples in relation to superannuation over 10 times in the last two years. My office has received hundreds of letters of support for my bill since its inception-interestingly enough, only one in opposition. In April this year the Body Shop entered the debate and launched a `same sex, same rights' campaign to support my bill. Letters and petitions flooded in from all over the country. In June of this year the report by Commissioner Chris Sidoti of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, entitled Superannuation entitlements of same sex couples, was tabled in parliament. The report condemned current legislation that allows discrimination against same sex couples. The report regarded this as contrary to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Commissioner Sidoti recommended that Commonwealth legislation be amended to allow surviving same sex partners to benefit in superannuation schemes. So why has this advice been ignored, just as have been the opinions of the public, of the superannuation industry, of the legal community, of the trade union movement and of the gay and lesbian community? The Labor government's superannuation initiatives mean that now more than 93 percent of full-time employees, 67 percent of part-time employees and 59 percent of casual employees are covered by superannuation. The success of these initiatives makes it even more important that the fruits of universal superannuation are exactly that-universal. I have argued throughout this debate that my bill is not about special rights for gay and lesbian couples. It is about introducing equal rights, rights that every other Australian worker living in a domestic relationship with someone they love would be perfectly entitled to expect. This private member's bill allows for a gay or lesbian worker to properly provide for their surviving partner and children in the event of their death. As the legislation currently stands, gay and lesbian couples are clearly discriminated against. I am proud to reintroduce this bill today, although I am not proud that in Australia in the late 20th century a bill such as mine is still stymied by a government scared of taking a stance against discrimination. I want to place on the record that if this bill is forced to lapse again, if the government still refuses to take a stand, I will be moving an amendment to the next appropriate piece of govern ment legislation that comes before the House. My amendment will give same sex couples equal rights regarding superannuation. I know that a number of coalition MPs support my private member's bill and I thank them for their courage in their public support of that bill. By moving an amendment to government legislation in the House of Representatives, I will force the government to vote on the issue rather than simply sweeping it under the carpet. The government cannot ignore this issue. It will not go away. Change is inevitable. That was acknowledged when the ALP and minor parties were successful with Senate amendments to remove discrimination in do-it-yourself superannuation funds. When that bill came back to the House of Representatives, the government reluctantly accepted this position and voted for that legislation. What we need on this issue is vision and principle. On policy issues that require guts, issues that require real moral leadership, this government prevaricates, it delays, it stalls. This is not a government of social reform. It is a government dedicated to social division. I urge members of the House to support this bill."
