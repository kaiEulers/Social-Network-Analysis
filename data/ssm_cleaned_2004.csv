12929,2004-05-24,SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS (ENSURING EQUALITY) BILL 2004,First Reading,Michael Organ,1,AG,Cunningham,3," This simple, though powerful, bill delivers on a longstanding Greens policy-a policy which opposes all discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. The Same Sex Relationships (Ensuring Equality) Bill 2004 relies upon section 109 of the Constitution to override all laws, both federal and state, that are clearly homophobic or discriminatory. Specifically, this bill makes it unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on a person's sexuality which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the enjoyment or exercise of the person's public or private life. To avoid doubt, this bill makes unlawful any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on a person's sexuality as it relates to: Marriage, adoption, superannuation, employment entitlements, access to reproductive or health services, and the lawful age of consent to sexual activity. There is clearly no place for discrimination based on sexual orientation in our society. This bill is timely for the public eye is once again upon this place over travel entitlements and the issue of personal relationships. Hypocrisy and double standards are being exposed to the wider community. There is no doubt, for example, that it is inequitable that the long-term same sex life partners of federal parliamentarians are denied access to spouse travel. The rules need to be changed, and above all same sex life partner relationships in our society need to be recognised. We have the present situation where same sex partners in our armed forces are actively discriminated against in areas such as housing, yet other federal government bodies such as the Australian Federal Police and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade do not discriminate. I have been informed of lifelong partners being refused access to superannuation entitlements and pensions. The discrimination is widespread. Australia is a modern, diverse society. Relationships are also diverse. We, as federal parliamentarians, must recognise that diversity and reflect it in this place. We must ensure that legislation made by this parliament does not discriminate against ordinary Australians. That is our obligation, our civic duty. And there is no doubt that present laws are discriminatory. As a Catholic I abhor discrimination. I also respect the institution of marriage. And I see no conflict between my beliefs, the message of love for our fellow human beings which I received from my Catholic upbringing, and the bill before us. I strongly believe that we should respect the right of individuals to a loving, lifelong relationship-whether they be heterosexual, homosexual, lesbian or transgender-regardless of their sexuality. A relationship based on love and commitment. For that is what this bill is all about-removing discrimination against those who may happen to fall in love, make a commitment to each other and decide to live in a relationship which in the past has been legally defined as marriage but which, in Australia in 2004, is much more diverse. There is no doubt that this is a contentious issue in the community. However, this bill is a piece of legislation arising out of compassion for our fellow Australians-Australians who are being unfairly discriminated against. We must remove that discrimination. It is the right thing to do. Sure, there are those in the community who do not agree with same sex relationships. There are also those in the gay, lesbian and transgender community who do not believe in marriage-just as there are in the heterosexual community. But there are thousands of Australians who are suffering and being discriminated against, as I speak, because of the present outmoded and discriminatory laws. You do not wait to ask slaves if they want to be free, Mr Deputy Speaker; you free them! The times are changing, and more and more Australians are questioning the existence of discriminatory laws. As a recent article in Tertangala, the University of Wollongong student magazine, pointed out: Who, indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker? As federal parliamentarians we must continue to fight to remove racism, sexism, homophobia and other prejudices from our laws. This bill goes part of the way to achieving this. I therefore commend it to the House."
13023,2004-05-27,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Philip Ruddock,1,LP,Berowra,2," In introducing this bill it is important to explain the background to it. This bill is necessary because there is significant community concern about the possible erosion of the institution of marriage. The parliament has an opportunity to act quickly to allay these concerns. The government has consistently reiterated the fundamental importance of the place of marriage in our society. It is a central and fundamental institution. It is vital to the stability of our society and provides the best environment for the raising of children. The government has decided to take steps to reinforce the basis of this fundamental institution. Currently, the Marriage Act 1961 contains no definition of marriage. It does contain a statement of the legal understanding of marriage in the words that Commonwealth authorised marriage celebrants must say before they solemnise a marriage. Section 46 of the Marriage Act deals with that. Those words are: The government believes that this is the understanding of marriage held by the vast majority of Australians. It is time that those words form the formal definition of marriage in the Marriage Act. This bill will achieve that result. Including this definition will remove any lingering concerns people may have that the legal definition of marriage may become eroded by time. A related concern held by many people is that there are now some countries that permit same sex couples to marry. It has been reported that there are a few Australian same sex couples who may travel overseas to marry in one of these countries on the basis that their marriage will then be recognised under Australian law on their return. Australian law does, as a matter of general principle, recognise marriages entered into under the laws of another country, with some specific exceptions. It is the government's view that this does not apply to same sex marriages. The amendments to the Marriage Act contained in this bill will make it absolutely clear that Australia will not recognise same sex marriages entered into under the laws of another country, whatever country that may be. As a result of the amendments contained in this bill same sex couples will understand that, if they go overseas to marry, their marriage, even if valid in the country in which it was entered into, will not be recognised as valid in Australia. The government has reiterated its fundamental opposition to same sex couples adopting children. In the view of the majority of Australians, children, including adopted children, should have the opportunity, all other things being equal, to be raised by a mother and a father. This bill will prevent same sex couples from adopting children from overseas under international arrangements involving bilateral or multilateral treaties. The bill does not interfere with adoptions that occur entirely under the law of a foreign country that do not depend on bilateral or multilateral arrangements. These are matters primarily for the country concerned. In summary, this bill makes clear the government's commitment to the institution of marriage. It will provide certainty to all Australians about the meaning of marriage into the future. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. By way of explanation, I might just say that the Prime Minister recently spoke on this matter and foreshadowed that there would be legislation dealing with certain taxation matters. That will be introduced in another place at an appropriate time."
13230,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Nicola Roxon,0,ALP,Gellibrand,1," We know that commitment, care, companionship and a desire for happiness can go across all different forms of families in Australia. So it is unfortunate that much of the debate that has surrounded the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, although having little to do with the actual terms of the bill, has often smacked of intolerance and prejudice. This may have been the Prime Minister's intention, but I do not believe that this reflects the thinking of most Australians. In fact, most of us know how hard it is to find a life partner and happiness and how precious it is to nurture and support those relationships once we do. What I think has been lost in this debate about changes to the Marriage Act is that many people in Australia live in long-term, committed relationships but are not married. In fact, nearly one-third of people over the age of 15 are not married, nor have they ever been married, but many of those five million people are in long-term relationships. Australians not only tolerate but welcome, support and barely bat an eyelid at de facto couples living in our community. With very few exceptions, de facto couples and their families get the rights and recognition of their married neighbours. Clearly marriage has remained the choice of the majority of Australians, but it is not the only form of relationship recognised or supported in our community. Many thousands of Australian couples each year choose to get married by making a public declaration-recognised by our state and often undertaken by a service in church-of love and commitment between each other. In 2001 there were 103,100 marriages registered across Australia, with more than half being performed by civil celebrants and 47 percent being performed by ministers of religion. Sadly, we also know that the likelihood of divorce is increasing, with 55,300 divorces being registered in that same year of 2001-the highest number in 20 years. Despite these changing trends in marriage and divorce rates, marriage has remained a robust institution in Australia. In our country marriage has always been a heterosexual institution and has always been recognised as such by our common law. To very many Australians marriage is a vital social and religious institution and has particular significance for its structural role in the raising of a family. It must be acknowledged that these strong views in our community are an important reason for retaining marriage as it is. Unlike in some other countries, there has been very little debate in Australia so far about the need to change marriage in any way. In fact, most discussion and correspondence to public representatives like me tend to focus on better ways to support families of whatever nature, on how to encourage people to get married and on ideas people have on keeping relationships intact. There is much more focus on tolerance and the removal of discrimination than there is on the nature of marriage. It was not until this bill was proposed by the government that calls were made more widely for marriage to be broadened to encompass same-sex couples. There has not been extensive community debate or consultation about this issue and it would be fair to say that there are many Australians who strongly object to the idea. There is no consensus in the gay and lesbian community about it either. In truth, though, I think this bill is not driven by a belief that marriage is an institution under attack but more by the Prime Minister's determination to shore up his leadership by responding to a demand from 30 backbenchers who may otherwise have caused trouble for him. He clearly wanted to make a symbolic statement about his family values rather than put money or much needed support into families who might otherwise be worthy of his attention in upholding his ideas of family values. Yet all he is effectively doing with this bill is spelling out what is already part of our law in a gesture that was crafted to offend members of the gay and lesbian community. In contrast, Labor has a strong record of delivering same-sex law reforms that actually benefit gay and lesbian individuals and couples at the state level and is committed to doing so federally if it wins the election. Labor is proud of the work it has undertaken within the party, particularly with Rainbow Labor, and with the broader community over the last year. We have developed a policy that commits Labor to comprehensive, long-term reform in recognising same-sex couples. It is not our intention, and it was not our intention prior to the introduction of this bill, to alter the meaning of marriage; rather, we want to take up the more pressing issues raised with us as priorities and pursue reform to ensure that same-sex couples get the recognition of heterosexual de facto couples. These broader reforms will be the subject of an amendment to be moved in the consideration in detail stage by my colleague, the member for Sydney, who has a passionate commitment to justice and fair treatment for same-sex couples. Labor's commitment to a full audit of Commonwealth legislation and the removal of discriminatory provisions across areas such as superannuation, taxation, veterans affairs, social security and much more is the most comprehensive package of same-sex reforms ever put forward by a major party. We are also committed to legislating anti-vilification and anti-harassment measures. The Howard government has no such plan and no such intention to address the discrimination that happens in everyday life for same-sex couples. The Howard government is happy to put forward this sort of legislation in a manner that might actually make prejudice and harassment worse rather than better-a promotion of intolerance which surely would not be the aim of any real leader in our community. Labor does not want a bill that in the main spells out the existing common law, perhaps unnecessarily, and does not want this bill to divert from the broader cause of promoting tolerance in our community and preventing discrimination against same-sex couples. To fight on the issue of radically changing the definition of marriage when it is so contested in the community would risk setting back the cause of same-sex law reform extensively. In relation to intercountry adoption, the government seeks to change the current law and make the Commonwealth responsible for an issue that, to date, it has not had within its purview. Accordingly, Labor will not support that part of the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, and I will move an amendment during the consideration in detail stage to remove schedule 2-the schedule which deals with intercountry adoptions-from this bill. The government has also indicated that it is prepared to look at the issue of equal treatment for superannuation benefits for same-sex couples, a longstanding policy of the Labor Party, and we welcome the government's conversion to this long-overdue cause. We question, though, why this part of the government's announced changes is not part of the bill before us in the House being debated today. Why is it that we still have not seen any proposed legislation dealing with superannuation? Why is it still in the drafting stage and not being introduced alongside the bill that we are debating? The government has already said its changes will go beyond same-sex couples to those in interdependent relationships, and we question whether this is causing some of the delay and why it is that the government cannot adopt the simple change that we have proposed for so long. For several years, the government have refused to let parliament consider and debate a bill put forward by the Labor member for Grayndler in relation to giving same-sex couples equal treatment under superannuation legislation. The Labor Party first introduced a private member's bill on this matter in 1998, six years ago, and the government have never let it be debated. Despite their recent announcement that they would support this policy change, the government again voted against this bill on 3 June 2004. My colleagues the members for Melbourne Ports and for Grayndler will move amendments in the consideration in detail stage of the debate-a fitting recognition of the work that they and others have done in the party over many years to bring this issue to public attention. I will now turn to the provisions of the bill in detail and move my second reading amendment, making clear Labor's position on this bill and on same-sex law reform issues more generally. The provisions of the bill, as I have already flagged, deal with three major changes: firstly, to insert a definition of marriage that states that marriage is between a man and woman; secondly, to prohibit the recognition of foreign same-sex marriages in Australia; and, thirdly, to prohibit same-sex couples from adopting children from overseas. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House: (1)	opposes the proposals related to inter-country adoption as unwarranted and unjust interference by the Commonwealth into an area already tightly regulated by States and Territories and within their legislative responsibility; and (2)	notes Labor's strong stance against discrimination on the grounds of sexuality, and, in particular, Labor's; (a)	recognition and acknowledgement of same sex couples and their right to be full and active members of our community, free from discrimination and vilification; (b)	commitment to an audit of all Commonwealth legislation following which legislative measures that are discriminatory on the basis of sexuality will be removed, thus ensuring equivalent status for same sex couples and de facto heterosexual couples; and (3)	particularly notes Labor's long-standing commitment to removing discrimination against same sex couples by implementing measures already proposed by Labor to remove discrimination in the area of superannuation. This amendment clearly sets out Labor's view on each of these matters. Let me turn first to the definition of marriage. It is clear that the first provision of this bill expressly clarifies and confirms the existing common-law position that Australia recognises the institution of marriage as being a union between a man and a woman. This country has never accepted the notion, either through the parliament or through the courts, that marriage is anything other than an institution recognising the union of a man and a woman. Currently, the Marriage Act 1961 does not include a specific definition of marriage in the definition provisions. However, the words to be used by celebrants in undertaking a marriage are prescribed and state that marriage is a union between a man and a woman. This can be found in section 46 of the act. Similarly, the Family Law Act 1975 requires the Family Court to perform its function having regard to: Various courts and tribunals have affirmed that this is the legal meaning of marriage in Australia, and, whilst the relevant clause in the bill is probably unnecessary and might be seen by many to be provocative, it is not actually taking away anyone's existing rights. Late last year the federal Labor caucus, in endorsing our package of the other reforms that I have referred to, agreed to keep marriage as it is commonly understood: between a man and a woman. In these circumstances, we cannot oppose the government's bill in this regard. The second change proposed by the government goes to the recognition of same-sex marriages undertaken overseas in jurisdictions that allow and recognise same-sex marriage. Consistent with our decision to retain marriage as an institution between men and women, we could not support Australians going overseas to marry, seeking to bypass Australian law. Accordingly, we will also not oppose this provision. I do flag, however, some concerns that citizens of other countries, who are lawfully married in their own countries and who may then come to Australia later-either in other circumstances or through immigration-are likely to be caught in this provision. We will ask the Senate committee to which we will refer this bill to consider the consequences of this, along with the other issues that we believe need to be dealt with. It is true that in recent times some countries overseas have moved to legalise same-sex marriages and that ceremonies have taken place in Canada, the United States and European countries. Even though some Australians may have chosen to go overseas and participate in these marriage ceremonies, it was clear to them at the time that these marriages were being conducted under the laws of another country, and there was no suggestion that this would automatically lead to recognition of their marriage when they returned to Australia. The third major provision deals with intercountry adoption by same-sex couples. This is an amendment to the Family Law Act. It prohibits intercountry adoption by Australian same-sex couples and confirms the government's fundamental opposition to any same-sex adoption. Labor agrees that adoption is a complex issue but does not believe that a blanket ban at the federal level is the best way to ensure that the interests of the child will always be given top priority. It is simply wrong to suggest that an orphaned child in a Third World country could never be better off with loving, gay parents in Australia who have passed all the rigorous checking and scrutiny required by the process for adoption. The reality is that almost no overseas countries allow such adoption, and most Australian states do not allow it either. This interference by the Commonwealth ignores the fact that-even by the government's own admission on numerous occasions, including when it announced the detail of this bill-both the policy development and the administration in relation to adoption matters is the responsibility of state and territory governments. In fact in 1998, when the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties considered whether or not to ratify the Hague convention on intercountry adoption, the Howard government agreed that, in ratifying this agreement, it would be most appropriate for state and territory governments to retain responsibility for adoption policies and procedures. There was no suggestion back in 1998-or since that time-that the Commonwealth should take a more active role in determining who should and should not be eligible to apply for intercountry adoptions. The comprehensive and rigorous testing procedures that are currently in place and covered by state and territory laws and regulations all require a thorough screening of all applicants seeking adoption of children, both here in Australia and overseas. The parliament might also note that there have never been any designated gay adoptions in Australia. Some known child adoptions may have been made to gay adoptive parents, but as records are not kept this is impossible to confirm. The government itself acknowledges that it does not have power to override the states in this area and has decided not to intervene in the ACT. However, because this provision deals with adoption from overseas, the government claims that reliance on the Hague Convention on Protection and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption gives it some power in this regard, even though the states still administer the process. Clearly this provision will intervene in the area acknowledged by the government to be within state control. Supporting this provision would create confusion and inconsistency. It should also be noted, as I have mentioned briefly before, that there are currently no countries with which Australia has bilateral agreements on adoption that permit adoption to same-sex couples in any case. The Attorney-General's assertion last month in parliament that Labor is somehow trying to prioritise overseas adoption to same-sex couples, over adoption to opposite-sex couples, is completely inaccurate and simply silly. I foreshadow that Labor will move an amendment to this bill in the consideration in detail stage, to omit this provision from the bill. We will be moving an amendment opposing the provision on the grounds that it is an inappropriate use of Commonwealth power and an unnecessary interference in the state and territory government role of running our country's adoption programs. When the issue arose in the ACT, our leader, Mark Latham, stated that adoption laws are clearly the province of state and territory governments and that the issue of adoption should be governed by the best interest of the child on a case-by-case basis. The blanket ban being proposed by the government would not allow any case-by-case assessment. The suggestion that opposing this provision will bring down the entire intercountry adoption regime for Australian couples is completely without basis, and I am sure the Attorney-General-and I am glad he is here today-knows that.  The Attorney also knows-or should do if he has been properly briefed by his own staff and departmental officers-that there are very small numbers of children available for intercountry adoption and very long waiting lists of Australian couples wishing to adopt. The countries with which we currently have agreements do not allow adoption by same-sex couples, and until they change their policies there is no likelihood of same-sex couples in Australia ever being considered for adoption under these programs. Therefore, for all the grief and vilification this proposal brings to existing Australian same-sex couples who are successfully raising children and leading happy family lives, there would be little or no practical impact from passing the government proposal to prohibit intercountry adoption. My second reading amendment to this bill, which will be seconded by my colleague the member for Brisbane, who also has a strong interest in this area, makes clear that the Labor Party wants the provisions relating to superannuation benefits for same-sex couples to be included as part of the current bill, rather than as an add-on at some point in time, in the future-a point in time that may never happen, based on past form of this government. The gay and lesbian community was promised a package of measures by the Prime Minister, with superannuation included as part of that package. In fact, it was the only part of the package that would have any real and immediate impact; however, it is the one part that the government has not yet delivered on. We understand that it may come into the parliament sometime in this sitting, but Labor is not prepared to hold its breath. Therefore, I would also like to foreshadow a number of alternative amendments on superannuation: one seeks to include our suggested superannuation changes directly into this bill; failing that, the other seeks to delay the commencement of this bill before us today until the superannuation provisions are put in place, whether in another piece of legislation or in this one. This will mean that the government's proposed changes to the Marriage Act will not come into effect until they deliver on their promise to deliver equality to same-sex couples in relation to their superannuation benefits. This is a fair deal and would hold the Prime Minister and this government to their original commitment. In conclusion, it is clear that this bill has come from a Prime Minister who has nothing else to put on the agenda of the parliament. That he is prepared, in order to bring forward this bill, to halt public debate on such issues of substantial importance to the Australian community as workplace relations, health, family payments, education, definitions of charitable organisations and a whole raft of other pieces of legislation just shows how desperate the government has become. In the absence of any real agenda to support the families of Australia, we have a bill with two provisions that confirm the existing law and one that interferes with a matter that is clearly the responsibility of the states and territories. Our response is that we will not be opposing the measures to confirm the existing definition of marriage and to only recognise those foreign marriages that meet this definition, but we will be opposing the measures to prohibit intercountry adoption. We will also be referring the full bill to a Senate committee so that the community can have its say on the bill before it goes to a vote in the Senate. On an issue concerning such an important social matter, we believe that the views of more than 30 government backbenchers need to be heard. As I have said during my speech, Labor will also be moving a number of amendments in the consideration in detail stage of the debate. They will cover the following issues: that the provisions of the legislation be enacted only once the beneficial provisions of the superannuation bill have passed; that schedule 2 of this bill relating to the issue of intercountry adoption by same-sex couples be removed; and, as an alternative policy, that the provisions of Labor's superannuation for same-sex couples bill, as first introduced to this House by the member for Grayndler in 1998, be moved as an amendment to this bill.  I urge the government, if it is serious about providing equal access to superannuation benefits to same-sex couples, to support the Labor amendments to this bill. By refusing to support our amendments, the government will just be proving that it is not really committed to broadening the superannuation schemes and that it never intended for these measures to be delivered as part of a package. Similarly, I urge members of the government to support our amendments in relation to intercountry adoption. In doing so, they should take heed of the Prime Minister's own acknowledgement at the press conference when he announced this package and said, `adoptions in this country are governed by state law'. This is clear in the Constitution and in its current practice, and unless the government wants to completely rewrite the country's adoption laws and procedures, not to mention tinker with the Constitution, this role should properly remain with the states and territories. Labor remains a party committed to families and supports the choice of couples to marry or live in other committed relationships. We would all do well in this House to consider how we can support and encourage long-term relationships, particularly for the benefit of children that might be in them, and not be too distracted by this diversion, which has very little practical impact and could cause much harm and offence to many members of the community. I urge support for the second reading amendment moved in my name and foreshadow the amendments that will be moved at the consideration in detail stage of the debate."
13231,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Christopher Pearce,1,LP,Aston,2," As the member for Aston I rise today to strongly argue for and to defend the institution of marriage. Without question, the widely accepted Australian understanding of marriage is that it is an institution between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others. The Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 has three key provisions: the first relates to the definition of marriage and the second and third provisions uphold that definition in relation to the recognition of marriages conducted overseas and adoptions proposed under an international agreement or arrangement. I strongly support all three provisions. Given that it is the first provision which guides the others, it is this provision that is paramount in this debate and sits above the others. In considering this bill, it is important to recognise why it has come before the House at this time. As many Australians would be aware, marriage in Australia is regulated by law, as it is in many countries that share our legal traditions. Whilst this is nothing new, recently there have been increasing attempts by those opposed to current marriage laws to aggressively seek to have those laws changed by judicial interference. Of particular concern, courts in Canada and the US have recently ruled in favour of the recognition of same-sex marriages under law. The judicial activism reflected in these judgments is not unique or isolated to these countries alone. It is exactly this kind of judicial activism that must not be countenanced in Australia. It is therefore paramount and necessary that the Australian parliament acts to uphold our marriage laws in the face of potential judicial activism and interference. In doing this, it is important to note that the parliament is fulfilling one of its most important tasks: the task of reflecting the values of our society. So, when people hear some parliamentarians and others questioning the need for this bill, they should consider one crucial question: is the institution of marriage worth upholding and, indeed, reinforcing? I believe, as most Australians do, that the answer is a crystal clear yes. So with the understanding of why this parliament must act now to strengthen the institution of marriage, let me now turn to the benefits that will flow. In modern Australia, marriage as an institution is becoming less popular and less successful in producing happy and healthy families. The question is: should we accept this decline as inevitable or are there changes that we as a community can make that might reverse the downward spiral by encouraging more successful and enduring marriages? The fact is that during the past 40 years the dynamics of Australian families have changed dramatically. A recent report by the Centre for Independent Studies revealed increases in the rate of divorce, the number of children living in single parent families, the percentage of children living apart from their natural parents and the number of births outside marriage. In fact, the proportion of married natural parents raising children together as a family is now at the lowest level in our entire history. The social ramifications of these changing characteristics have included increasing rates of depression and suicide, lower levels of educational achievement, greater behavioural problems among children and rising levels of parental neglect and abuse. At the same time, a US research report titled Why marriage matters has identified definitive benefits that marriage provides for all members of the family. The report reveals that children who live with both their natural married mum and dad enjoy better physical health on average than children in other family structures. Furthermore, the report shows that marriage reduces the risk that children and adults will be either perpetrators or victims of crime.  Not only does strengthening marriage support the individuals involved, it also has the potential to underpin broader societal improvements. An area of great concern is the decline in the birth rate over the past four decades. With the close correlation between the declining birth and marriage rates, encouraging more longer-lasting marriages can help address these fast-approaching demographic challenges. Given these potential social, economic and health impacts on adults and children, governments have a responsibility to act in the best interests of the nation. This means supporting the institution of marriage. Importantly, whilst initiating and supporting practical policy measures, the government should always be careful not to be intrusive or authoritarian in their approach. Governments must achieve a sense of balance in this regard. I believe that the necessary balance can best be achieved by promoting marriage through positive policy initiatives and law-making as the ideal."
13232,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Christopher Pearce,1,LP,Aston,2," To be upheld as an ideal, the institution of marriage requires social as well as legal support. Marriage must share a consistent and universal meaning and not be subject to redefinition for individualistic reasons. Marriage is one of our longest standing traditions and, as part of our Judaeo-Christian heritage, has provided the social bedrock for the development of Australian society. As a Christian, my own personal values and beliefs have been, and continue to be, strongly shaped by this traditional concept of marriage. And, despite the modern trend away from religious affiliation, I believe the majority of Australians continue to share these values and beliefs. Marriage is a union between a man and a woman, and it is the dynamics of that specific relationship which is so important for children. We need to have more children to sustain the future of our great nation and we need to do more to support the upbringing and development of our children. The time-honoured institution of marriage is the best way to achieve these goals. Marriage-the institution between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others-is a fundamental pillar in our society. It is a pillar that has stood strong for generations and is a cornerstone of the Australian way of life. The decision by the government to introduce this bill will serve to protect, reinforce and honour marriage. In doing so, this will strengthen Australian families, which, in turn, will strengthen Australian society. This outcome-a stronger and more connected community-will be good for all. It will be good not only for those of us here today but, most importantly, for generations to come."
13233,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Anthony Albanese,1,ALP,Grayndler,1," The previous speaker, the member for Aston, spoke about the importance of marriage. I got married a few years ago and indeed it was a wonderful occasion, with my family, the family of my wife, Carmel, and our closest and dearest friends. But we had been in that relationship for some time before the marriage, and the relationship between us as a de facto couple was as significant as it has been since we got married. Ceremony is important, but we should not pretend that marriage is an institution that has been around forever, because it has not. It is an institution that has evolved, just as relationships evolve and just as today it is recognised that couples in de facto relationships should have the same rights as married couples. That was not the case decades ago; that is something that has historically evolved. There are many relationships, both heterosexual and homosexual, that are committed, loving relationships. It is not up to me to judge whether the relationship between a particular man and a woman is more important, more significant or more loving than a relationship between a man and another man or between a woman and another woman. It is certainly my experience that some of the most committed, loving relationships are those of gay and lesbian friends. This bill is about what this government is always about: dividing Australia-bringing in a wedge between a perceived majority and a perceived minority. Why is there a need to affirm what is a common-law definition of marriage? The Marriage Act 1961, it is true, has no specific definition of marriage, but in section 46 it prescribes that celebrants must use the following words, `that marriage is a union between a man and a woman'. It is there. The Family Law Act 1975 says the court must have regard to: I believe that this is a bill which is not necessary and one which has caused great distress in the community, and I want to read some quotes from constituents of mine who feel offended by this government's actions. Lachlan Murray of Newtown wrote: Grea Korting of Stanmore wrote: Graham Ware of Petersham wrote: Marj O'Callaghan of Sumer Hill wrote: Irene Gale, not a constituent but from Kensington Park in Adelaide, wrote: Indeed, there has not been a considered debate in this country about gay marriages. The Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby and other organisations that I have consulted over the last eight years have not said to me: `I want you to do something about gay marriage.' It has not been a priority for them. Their priority has been to achieve equal rights. There is no consensus within the gay and lesbian community about the marriage issue, but what has caused offence is why the government has rushed in this legislation in what is possibly the last fortnight of parliamentary sittings. This bill is a result of 30 bigoted backbenchers who want to press buttons out there in the community. I am of the view that what is needed as a priority is the policy which Labor adopted last year. I pay tribute to the former shadow AttorneyGeneral, the member for Barton, for the work that he did in developing that policy and now to the member for Gellibrand for carrying it on. That policy has three key components to it. The first principle is that Labor believes that Australians are entitled to respect, dignity and the ability to participate in society and receive the protection of the law regardless of their sexuality or gender identity. The second principle is that Labor in government will work with all groups to reform federal laws to recognise the diversity of legitimate relationships in the Australian community. The third principle is that Labor will not be redefining marriage but will work to eliminate discrimination against Australians in same-sex relationships across a range of federal laws, including taxation, superannuation, immigration, family law, industrial relations and government benefits. That early policy development in consultation with the community made our response to this government action very easy, because we had had the debate internally and we had had the consultation with the community. We want to move forward to a situation whereby upon coming to government-and it is recognised in the amendments moved-we will have a full audit of all government legislation so as to remove discrimination so that gay and lesbian couples have the same rights as de facto heterosexual couples. That is our position, and Labor made it clear when we adopted that position that we would not be making any changes to the Marriage Act. Indeed, it was accepted by the community that that was not a priority. I stand by Labor's principled position on that issue in moving the debate forward, because it is important in areas of social change that the community moves forward as one. And the community has changed. The community has indeed moved a long way, to the point where the government is now saying-it is not doing it, but it is saying-that there will be some change made on the superannuation issue. That is quite remarkable. It is an example of agitation inside and outside this parliament to convince people of the need for change. I first raised the issue of equal entitlements for same-sex couples with regard to superannuation in a speech in December 1996. I raised it again in 1997 and throughout that year. In April 1998, I wrote to the Prime Minister asking for a bipartisan approach to this issue. I did that with, to their credit, the support of some of the members opposite, including the member for North Sydney and the member for Bradfield, who supported equality on this issue. On 25 May 1998, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr Chris Miles, the then member for Braddon and a member of the Lyons Forum, wrote back. He said: So on 22 June 1998 I introduced into this House, for the first time, the Superannuation (Entitlements of same sex couples) Amendment Bill. It lapsed when the election came around, so I introduced it again on 7 December 1998. Again the government would not allow debate on it but, thanks to the support of the then whip, the member for Watson, we actually got to a second reading stage on that occasion. That was on 7 June 1999. We introduced it again on 22 November 1999, and last week, on 2 June, we tried to introduce it into this House again. I have raised this issue in the House of Representatives 21 times. Suddenly, when the Prime Minister is asked whether entitlements to superannuation for same-sex couples will happen, he says, `I wouldn't do it if I didn't believe in it.' It took a long time for that conversion. However, there is a problem with how the government has done it, because it is not actually changing the definition of spouse, which is the appropriate way to do it. What it is doing is moving to interdependency, which will continue to have a discriminatory impact. Same-sex couples will be required to prove financial interdependence and emotional interdependence. They will also be excluded from some benefits of superannuation in the tax system, such as the spouse contribution rebate, because, whilst the government said that this was the other side of the equation, it was not prepared to make the acknowledgment that same-sex relationships can be as legitimate as heterosexual relationships. It was not prepared to do that.  I will be giving the government that opportunity. I foreshadow that I will be moving the following amendment to this bill, under schedule 3 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993: 1	Subsection 10(1) (definition of dependant) Repeal the definition, substitute: dependant, in relation to a person, includes the spouse, de facto partner, and any child of the person or of the person's spouse or de facto partner. 2	Subsection 10(1) (definition of spouse) Repeal the definition. 3	Subsection 10(1) Insert: de facto partner, in relation to a person, means a person who, whether or not the same gender as the person, lives with the person on a genuine domestic basis as a partner of the person. 4	At the end of subsection 52(2) Add: (i)	not to discriminate, in relation to a beneficiary, on the basis of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, transgender status, marital status, family responsibilities, religion, political opinion or social origin. I intend doing that to give the government the opportunity to really grant the same rights to same-sex couples as heterosexual couples have. The government has had those provisions for six years as part of my private member's bill. Not only has it not voted for it; it has failed to even allow a debate on it-much to its shame. Labor will also be moving amendments to exclude the provisions in this bill which seek to ban intercountry adoption by same-sex couples. We do that because that is a change in the law. We think it is best left to states and territories to look after provisions relating to adoption issues. What message does the government want to send? It sends the message that gay parents are bad parents. I believe very firmly that the best parent is a loving parent; that it is best for children to grow up in a caring, loving environment regardless of whether they have a single parent, a father and mother, two men, two women, or whether the child has been adopted. Whatever the situation, surely the critical issue is whether someone grows up in a loving environment. I want people on the other side to really think about who is hurt by the message that is being sent out. It is the children who are hurt. I was raised by my mother in an incredibly loving environment. My mother essentially gave up her personal life to raise me-as a lot of women do. A special bond exists between a mother and her child. I certainly agree that the ideal circumstance is for a child to have a male and female person to relate to. I think that is the ideal in an ideal world. But I do not pass judgment, because I know what the most important factor is. There are so many bad parents out there doing terrible things to their children. Most sexual abuse occurs within the family between fathers and young girls. And the government comes in and lectures us about the morality of people who have made a conscious decision to have a child. They really want to love and cherish a child-and they do.  I have seen a lot of bad parents. I have not seen bad same-sex parents. I do not know very many, but every same-sex couple I know really wants their child and loves their child. That should be respected-not this supposed moral nonsense. Fancy the marriage bill being debated in the House of Representatives of all places! This is a place where divorce is more common than marriages sticking together. Yet we have people here attempting to lecture this nation about the appropriate structure of the family."
13234,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Peter Dutton,1,LP,Dickson,2," The hypocrisy that has been demonstrated this afternoon by the member for Grayndler, representing the Australian Labor Party, is really breathtaking. It has to be put on the public record this afternoon that, if the member for Grayndler has any shred of decency in this place, if he is about what he says he is about this afternoon, he will vote this bill down. He is no different from the member for Werriwa, who has one view on one day and a different view on another day; he has one view for a particular audience and a different view for the second audience that he addresses the following afternoon. It is a disgrace for the member for Grayndler to come into this parliament this afternoon to talk down this initiative by this government and then turn around when the vote comes and vote for this piece of legislation. The Australian people and those in the member for Grayndler's electorate should recognise that he has embarrassed himself this afternoon and exposed the Labor Party for the hypocrisy that it continues to demonstrate on this bill. One of the reasons that the bill has come before this House is that the Howard government believes very strongly that the definition of marriage should not be left to the High Court or to the other courts of Australia to determine. There is a very real prospect that because the definition does not exist in the current Marriage Act 1961 a test case could be taken, and quite probably will be taken, to the High Court, and the definition of marriage would then be left to the judges. In my view, the Australian people want very strongly for the legislators, for their elected representatives in this country, to implement the laws that apply to the Australian people. By and large, they do not want the High Court, the Federal Court or the other courts of this nation to impose court-made law on them. So we are in the position where we want to provide strong leadership and strong government to the Australian people, and this is another demonstration of the way in which we will do this. This government make no apology for the fact that we strongly support the very solid institution of marriage in this country. That is not to say that we exclude those people who may be in same-sex relationships or people who determine that they wish to partake in same-sex relationships. That is a matter entirely for them. What we say today is that the institution of marriage, the cornerstone of Australian society, does need to be protected. If the Australian Labor Party is not prepared to stick up for the majority of the Australian people, then once again the Howard government will do it. In this country, according to the 2001 census, 0.5 percent of marriages were of same-sex couples. In my own electorate, in the 2001 census 53 couples were identified as being in a same-sex relationship. I do not take issue with those people. I do not suggest to them how they should run their lives, and I do not suggest to them that this government should do that. Certainly, that is not what we are doing through this legislation. What we are saying to the Australian people is that we believe the government need to enshrine the definition of marriage in legislation.  Quite rightly, in my view and in the view of this government, we need to represent the current, as well as the historical, legal understanding of marriage in Australian law. This will become the formal definition of marriage in legislation governing all marriages in Australia, including for those married overseas. This will ensure that the marriage of a couple of the same sex will not be possible in this country. Australian law generally recognises marriages entered into under the law of another country. However, under this bill, marriages between people of the same sex are not recognised as valid. The government proposes to amend the Marriage Act 1961 to ensure that marriages between people of the same sex, including those married under the law of another country, are not recognised in Australia-and that is an important point to emphasise as part of this debate. This will stop the courts extending the definition of marriage to same-sex couples. Importantly, the bill also amends the Family Law Act 1975 to make it clear that the adoption of children from overseas by same-sex couples, under either bilateral or multilateral arrangements, will not be recognised in Australia. All other things being equal, children have the right to have the opportunity to be raised by a loving mother and a loving father, and it is for this reason that the Howard government is fundamentally opposed to same-sex couples adopting children. Another one of the disgraceful representations made by the member for Grayndler this afternoon was that the highest incidence of sexual assault perpetrated on children in this country is by natural fathers. That is a lie; it is a misleading of the parliament, and it is a deception of the Australian people that needs to be highlighted as part of the debate today. One of the very clear facts out of the tragedy of child abuse, which nobody in this place or any right-thinking person in the Australian community would ever condone, is that there is a misnomer that natural parents, biological fathers, are responsible for the majority of sexual abuse towards their biological children. In actual fact, the point that the member for Grayndler quite necessarily glossed over in his speech was that most of the sexual assaults that sadly occur within family units are perpetrated by males introduced into relationships. That is a sad fact of the debate, but it is one that needs to be highlighted as part of today's discussion because of the deception perpetrated and the deliberate misleading, in my view, by the member for Grayndler in this chamber this afternoon. To the extent of its direct responsibility under the external affairs power, the government has decided that it will legislate to prevent adoptions by same-sex couples under these international arrangements being recognised in Australia. It is important to note as part of the debate today that under the Constitution the Commonwealth does not have the ability to restrict state-made law in relation to same-sex couples adopting children. It is interesting to note that over the last weekend, during its Labor Party conference, the Beattie government ruled out that Queensland would be introducing legislation to allow same-sex couples to adopt children-as the Labor Party has done in other states and territories, including the Australian Capital Territory. From my perspective, the Beattie government should be congratulated for that position. In that particular debate, I think that they represent the views of the majority of Australians.  Part of the balance of this bill will see amendments made to both the Income Tax Act 1986 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. Same-sex couples who reside together and are interdependent, but who may not be recognised under the current rules, will be eligible to receive superannuation benefits tax-free upon the death of their partner. My view is that that is an important measure within this bill. I do not think that a government of any persuasion has the ability to dictate to people how they should bequeath their assets or some benefit of a financial nature which is given to the estate of a particular person. It does demonstrate, as part of this debate, that the Howard government has a commitment to families and to people in relationships, but it does not believe that same-sex couples should enjoy the same recognition that marriage between heterosexual couples has enjoyed over generations. Importantly, this change will also include other interdependent people such as two elderly sisters living together or mentally handicapped people who might not have lived with the deceased but whose relationship was interdependent in its nature and who would not have been eligible for the tax-free death benefit. This proposal will provide greater certainty for the payment of death benefits between adults in an interdependent relationship, including members of same-sex relationships. However, amending the definition of `dependent' will not alter the definition of `spouse' and will not specifically recognise same-sex relationships. This proposal will provide people with greater scope to make a binding death nomination and determine who will receive the superannuation death benefits. However, the Howard government will recognise only heterosexual relationships with relation to the institution of marriage, as I alluded to a moment ago. By amending the Marriage Act, the Howard government is demonstrating its continuing strong ongoing commitment to the institution of families in this country. The last 8 years that this government has been in power certainly stand in stark contrast to the 13 years when the Labor Party were in government. The Howard government has been about providing support for Australian families wherever possible to let them succeed and achieve-supporting them in any way it possibly can. When we examine the way in which this government has continued to support families-and, in my view, it will continue to support families for decades to come-it stands in stark contrast to the Labor Party and people like the member for Banks, who sits at the table thinking that this debate is quite funny as if we talk about the support of Australian families in some sort of jest. I think it reflects on the member for Banks and, indeed, the Labor Party in general for their failure in relation to Australian families over the last 20 years or so. In my view it is appropriate in this debate today that we look at the support that this government has been providing to families. The recent budget is one demonstration of that support. This government is committed to protecting, securing and building Australia's future. To achieve this the coalition has consistently demonstrated a willingness to put Australia's national interest first. Families are the basis upon which our Australian society has been built, and that is the basis upon which the Australian community will continue over many decades to come. In the recent budget this government announced that the family assistance package would be the largest package ever put in place by an Australian government, being worth an estimated additional $19.2 billion over five years. It includes more generous family tax benefit arrangements, which will significantly help families with the costs of raising children and improve the rewards from working. Two million families will benefit from an increase of $600 a year in the maximum and base rates of family tax benefit part A for each dependent child, and each family receiving FTB part A in 2003-04 will also receive a lump sum payment of $600 per child before the end of this month. That is a demonstration, as this bill is, of the government's commitment to continue to support Australian families. The budget did not stop there, because, in addition, the withdrawal rate between the maximum and base rates of FTB part A will be further reduced from 30 percent to 20 percent. Families receiving FTB part B will benefit from a reduction in the income test withdrawal rate. There is a new maternity payment, and the expansion of outside school hours child care and family day care places will assist families balancing work and family commitments. The changes to FTB will help women re-enter the work force after having children. The Howard government also wants to enhance the superannuation co-contribution scheme and reduce the superannuation surcharge, boosting incentives to save for retirement and continuing the theme of supporting families. Another demonstration of the lack of support that the Australian Labor Party has for families is its intent to block that legislation in the other place. The Howard government has provided ongoing reform in Australian family assistance and the tax system. More Help for Families is a further major instalment to this reform. It is helping Australian families raise their children, helping them to balance their work and family responsibilities and improve the rewards from work. The opposition recently admitted that the top-up FTB payments delivered to Australian families would be scrapped under Labor. It is important as we approach the election-whenever it may be in the coming months-that we recognise the fact that Labor have every intention of scrapping that particular measure. We need to recognise that and highlight to the Australian people and Australian families whenever we can that that is what Labor intend to do. Under Labor 500,000 families would lose $848 in payments. They admitted that they would abandon many payments and refused to guarantee that Australian families would not receive less family benefit under Labor. Where are the Labor policies that we keep hearing about? Of course, we have received the details of none. We have received the details of none because, like Labor economic policy in the past, we know that they are unfunded-they are incapable of being paid for-and Australian families would have more of the same. The coalition government believes in supporting families because they are the most important building block in society. The coalition government will continue to deliver to Australian families. The shadow Treasurer claims that Labor will collect less tax, spend more money and have a bigger surplus at the end, as well as set aside an intergenerational fund to fund tomorrow, but in some way, strangely, it will still have more money in the pot at the end of the day. It is a fraud. It is another Labor fraud. It is another Labor Latham fraud on the Australian people-like the support for this bill by the Labor Party in this place at this point in time. Make no mistake about it: the Australian Labor Party may voice support at this time for this bill, but it is fundamentally opposed to the introduction of this legislation. For its own cheap political points it has decided at this point in time to back this bill, and-as the member for Grayndler said before-it would be of a mind to repeal the legislation if it were ever voted into government.  If we are to continue about the government's belief and support for families, I think we need to look at the benefits that the Howard government has provided over the last eight years in terms of the economy. The member for Banks can scoff and look in amazement at the way in which this government has been able to provide support for families, because he knows that this government has been able to keep inflation low. The Labor Party knows that the federal coalition government has been able to keep unemployment below six percent, the lowest it has been in 23 years. Let us face it: if we were going to help families in this country, how would we do that? We would put the families, wherever they were able to do so, back into work. We would have people support their families. We would have them assist their children through good education. We would have them assist their families with good food, clothing and housing. And that stands in complete contrast to what the Labor Party would offer Australian families. The Australian Labor Party has a policy-in so many areas-that would destroy jobs and that would stand in contrast to the way in which this government has been able to provide for and support Australian families. It must be said that by the end of the current financial year a total of $70 billion of Labor debt will have been be repaid. That is only $26 billion shy of the $96 billion that they left us when we arrived here in government in 1996. It is very important to highlight again, as part of this debate, that the sad state in which the Australian Labor Party left the economy when they had governed for 13 years would be the same way that they would leave it if they were ever given the economic keys to this country again. I want to conclude my speech today by saying that we as a government-the Howard government-continue our very strong support of Australian families. We have demonstrated that through this bill today. We in this parliament, in this country, are not about discriminating against people who are in same-sex relationships, but we are about preserving the institution of marriage. We are about saying to the Australian people that we believe that marriage should be between heterosexual couples and that, if we are about providing a solid future for the children in this country, we should identify the need to support that institution. As I say, that is what we are doing today. But the Labor Party stand in stark contrast to that, because they say that they support this bill, but the fact of the matter is that if they had any political guts they would vote against it."
13235,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Stephen Smith,1,ALP,Perth,1," I accept that it is certainly the case that there would be strong views on this matter-strong views, genuinely held, in the community; strong views that are firmly put in different directions. Where strong views are firmly put and genuinely held they are entitled to be respected, just as we-as individuals, as a community, as a parliament and as a nation-should respect the genuine choices of life and lifestyle that people make. There is no monopoly, no mortgage, on the model by which people choose to live their lives together in a stable, long-term, caring, loving relationship, whether it is marriage in accordance with the Marriage Act, whether it is a bona fide, domestic, de facto relationship between a heterosexual couple or whether it is a loving, long-term, stable, caring relationship between a homosexual same-sex couple. There is no mortgage or monopoly on it. On that basis, it is my view that, as individuals, policy makers, parliamentarians and members of our local and general communities, our approach should respect that that is the case.  I also believe, and believe strongly, that marriage in Australian society has traditionally been recognised as an exclusive heterosexual institution: the union between a man and a woman. The Marriage Act 1961 reflects that, whilst it does not necessarily define it as such; the Family Law Act 1975 reflects that, whilst it does not necessarily define it as such; and it is unquestionably the case, in my view, that the common law reflects that. So I agree that, from an institutional point of view, there is no difficulty with defining marriage-if you want to-as an exclusive institution for a relationship between a man and woman. I have no difficulty with that. As a consequence, I have no difficulty with that part of the legislation, even if one puts to one side the motives of the Prime Minister in this matter. Equally, I have no difficulty with the vital role that the institution of marriage has played in Australia in our history since European settlement; in our history, formally as a Commonwealth since Federation; or indeed in the modern Australia which started with our post-World War II migration program. Marriage has been a vital institution in our society-initially, exclusively, largely for childbearing, but also for other genuine community purposes: for stability in the community and stability in society. While on one hand marriage as an institution has always been exclusive in the way in which I have described it, it has also been the cause of discrimination. Perversely, in some respects, it has been the cause of discrimination because either you are in it or you have been outside it. Because you may have been within the institution of marriage, the causes of discrimination are probably not generally appreciated. It has been those discriminations that have flowed from being outside the institution that have been more widely recognised and have seen changes in state and Commonwealth law in the last 20 years or so. In historical terms, it was not all that long ago in my own state of Western Australia that if you were a woman and you were employed by the education department of Western Australia as a teacher to further the educational interests of children and you decided to get married, you were compelled to resign your position. So a woman in Western Australia who was employed by the education department as a teacher, who was bettering the educational interests of children, was compelled to resign and cease being employed in that vital capacity merely upon entering the institution of marriage. That is discrimination for being within the institution. Fortunately, that was removed a number of years ago. More generally appreciated is the discrimination which comes from not being within the institution. Historically, that has been recognised as the discrimination which is attended to a woman who has been a de facto, rather than a de jure, spouse-that is, a woman who has been in a bona fide domestic heterosexual relationship with a man. As a consequence of not being within the institution, discrimination has flowed. Discrimination has flowed in a property sense, in a will and probate sense, in the administration of a deceased estate's sense and in a social security sense. So a number of discriminations flowed to a woman for being a de facto spouse-a relationship not recognised by the nation state, as was the institution of marriage. Fortunately, it has been the case since the seventies that most of those discriminations which were almost invariably state based, or based in state legislation, have been systematically removed by the enactment of antidiscrimination legislation at the state and Commonwealth levels.  If you had been a child of a bona fide domestic heterosexual relationship-a de facto relationship rather than one recognised by the institution of marriage-all forms of discrimination attended you. It has not always been the case that the phrase, `You bastard,' has been a term of endearment. The mere fact of being outside the institution of marriage has been the cause of discrimination mostly against women but also against children-boys or girls-and men. Fortunately, we have removed most of those discriminations from state and Commonwealth statutes. One of the discriminations which used to attend to men was only removed last year in my own state. If you were a man in Western Australia and were in a bona fide domestic relationship with a woman, if you had all the trappings of marriage-a joint mortgage and children-but you were not within the institution of marriage, and if you were unfortunate and your wife predeceased you prior to your children becoming 18 or 21, as the case previously was, you were obliged to approach the Supreme Court of Western Australia and secure an order from that court to give you custody of your children, whether or not that custody was disputed. That was only recently-in 2003-removed from the law of Western Australia. Whilst the institution of marriage has been a vital institution in Australian society, the fact of being in it or the fact of being out of it has caused gross discriminations against men, women and children in the history of our nation. More recently, as these discriminations against heterosexual de facto couples have been removed, we have moved to the discrimination against homosexual couples or same-sex couples. That is why in this case I make the removal of discrimination not only my starting point but also my end point: it is the first and last public policy priority. If you look at the discrimination which has been attended to homosexual couples, same-sex couples, in recent years, as parliamentarians, individuals and members of the community we have come to appreciate the discrimination which is attended upon those people in the long-term, stable, loving, caring relationships that they choose. To his great credit, my good friend and colleague the member for Grayndler has harassed this chamber to seek to remove the discrimination in the superannuation area which is attended upon same-sex couples. To its credit, the previous Labor administration in a number of areas sought to relieve the discriminatory burden. In my current shadow ministry portfolio, we have seen the introduction of interdependent spouse visas to enable same-sex couples not to be discriminated against when it comes to the migration regime of our nation. Because of my priority-the removal of discrimination-I absolutely and strongly support paragraphs 2 and 3 of the second reading amendment which state: (2)	notes Labor's strong stance against discrimination on the grounds of sexuality, and, in particular, Labor's; (a)	recognition and acknowledgement of same sex couples and their right to be full and active members of our community, free from discrimination and vilification; (b)	commitment to an audit of all Commonwealth legislation following which legislative measures that are discriminatory on the basis of sexuality will be removed, thus ensuring equivalent status for same sex couples and de facto heterosexual couples; That will remove the discrimination which as a community we have become more appreciative of in recent years and which was attended upon de facto heterosexual couples in previous years. So far as the issue of adoption is concerned, it is so well-known these days that the number of adoptions is so small that I see no reason to remove adoption from the case-by-case assessment of our state and territory jurisdictions. What the Prime Minister is doing in this case is straining to find a Commonwealth head of power to inveigle the Commonwealth into an arrangement in that area, not to better the public policy framework but to make a cynical political point. I think it is incumbent upon us as individuals, members of our own communities-local and national-and members of this parliament to accept that there are different models for long-term, caring, loving relationships. Some of those relationships have been and can be recognised by the state. Some of those relationships have been, can be and are recognised by the church or churches. Some of those relationships are recognised by the community in a formal or informal sense. I think it is absolutely important, whether one of those relationships is or is not recognised by the state, that it is not the vehicle for discrimination-that its presence or absence is not the vehicle for discrimination. That is why it is incumbent upon us, in my view, to make our highest public policy priority the removal of those discriminations, and the vast bulk of that discrimination now attends to same-sex couples. Once this parliament and the state and territory parliaments have done that then, from a personal point of view, I have no objection to those people who say, `We'd like to have a conversation about some form of civil recognition of same-sex couples who want to publicly show that they are in a long-term, stable relationship outside the institution of marriage.' From a personal point of view I have no objection to that, if only because it might actually be helpful as a point of evidence as to the existence of a long-term, stable, bona fide domestic relationship. But the highest priority in this issue is from the standpoint of a sensible public policy framework, not from the standpoint of a cheap, cynical political manoeuvre. The priority in this issue is to stand up and say that the institution of marriage-both being in it and outside of it-has, historically in Australian society, whilst serving us well as a vital institution, advertently or inadvertently been the cause of discrimination against people who happen to choose a different model of the relationship that they want to share with a long-term, loving partner. In my view, the obligation is upon us to remove those discriminations without fear and without favour."
13236,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Barry Wakelin,1,LP,Grey,4," I am quite delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this bill. But I think it is even more remarkable that society has come to this and feels the need to state what marriage actually is. The legislation deliberately does not attempt to define biologically a man or a woman, and I think that is prudent. So, the sole purpose, as far as I am concerned, is to recognise marriage as an important symbol and as a special event. It states to the community the intention of two people, with the hope of family and community, to have children and continue the generations. I am somewhat amazed at the opposition's position. As the member for Dickson advised us, if you were to listen to the speeches you would believe that Labor is actually opposing this legislation. But of course it is not. I find it quite remarkable that I can listen to those speeches and think, `I am sure that they are opposing it,' knowing that opposition members are actually going to vote for it. As I say, I find that quite remarkable. Perhaps it is worth mentioning that the word `marriage' in the English language is in itself an adequate description. I agree with the wording in the legislation about how we attempt to define marriage, but a relationship between a same-sex couple is-not denying in any way the legitimacy or the genuineness of those relationships-a different form of relationship. There is a fundamental difference in that kind of relationship. You can call it something of equal status if you must but, to my mind, it is certainly not marriage. If we look at our society over the last 25 years, we see, for instance, the new Family Court regulations from the Lionel Murphy days and the increase in the marriage breakdown rate. We have had many debates in this place, and many parliamentarians have participated, through the parliamentary committees, in discussions about the Child Support Agency. If ever there was a state intrusion into relationships between individuals-particularly men and women in this land-there is nothing more intrusive than the Child Support Agency and the Family Court. To say that this parliament should not be bothered about defining marriage is something that I find quite remarkable. I suppose that some people might argue that the rate of marriage breakdown in our society questions, in itself, the state of marriage. But the really interesting thing to me is that people, once having married, can go on and marry two or even three times. So there is something very special, and people start with great ambitions in their relationships. But fundamental to those relationships and the children that may follow is stability, love and the support that every young person and every child is entitled to. I do not think anyone is going to try to argue or deny that, within the institution of marriage, within the relationship and the responsibility of a mother and a father, there is no stronger way of expressing those responsibilities than through marriage. In supporting the legislation before us today, can I quickly sum up by saying that marriage is special, it is an important symbol, it is about family, and it is about nurturing family and the stability of our society. It is important that we recognise the stresses and pressures that are on marriage. With this debate in the parliament we are reinforcing the value of marriage and what marriage is, and I think it gives clear leadership in a way which is very much needed. As I said, I am disappointed that the Labor Party cannot be more direct in supporting this legislation. They sound like they are opposing it, but in fact they are going to support it. I believe that the vital thing that this parliament should never forget is that this is the only voice that the people have. The High Court does not give the people a voice, the Federal Court does not give the people a voice, but this place does-as inadequately as it might do sometimes. This place is the only place the people of Australia will have a voice, and I am absolutely delighted and proud to give voice to those people who I know will welcome this legislation in support of marriage."
13237,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Arch Bevis,1,ALP,Brisbane,1," I support Labor's amendments to the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. In particular, I am pleased that I have been able to second Labor's second reading amendment. There are two parts to that amendment, and time will probably not allow me to go into them in full, but I do think it is important that Labor's second reading amendment acknowledges the view of this side of the parliament that there should be no discrimination on the grounds of sexuality and that it should be recognised and acknowledged that same-sex couples have the right to a full and active involvement in our community, free from discrimination and vilification. I think it is also important that we note at this time the need for legislation to remove the discrimination against same-sex couples in the area of superannuation-something that I will return to shortly. This bill would not be here at all if we were not at the starting blocks for an election in which the Liberal government is in some trouble. There have been no Australian same-sex marriages as there have been in the United States. The number of Australian same-sex marriages recognised at law today, before this bill is passed, is a grand total of zero. If this bill were never introduced and we were discussing this issue in a year's time, the grand total of same-sex marriages recognised in Australian law would be zero. This is not a piece of legislation to deal with an issue of public policy. This is, as we have seen so often from this Prime Minister, a tactic in the lead-up to an election, for political gain. This is another piece of wedge politics. The Prime Minister in his period in office has sought so many times to divide this nation, not to unite it. He did so in 2001 before the election. We all recall the `children overboard' saga, which we now know to be the truth overboard. This Prime Minister and this government have sought to vilify minorities, to marginalise those who hold different views and to attack those who disagree with this government as unpatriotic or un-Australian. These are the tactics of the United States far Right. These are also the tactics of John Howard's Liberal Party. That is the genesis of this bill, brought to you by John W. Howard in association with George W. Bush. When John Howard goes to Washington he should talk to Vice-President Cheney on these things, not to President Bush. He would get a different picture. Interestingly, this bill has not only been introduced for, clearly, political and tactical reasons on the verge of an election but it has been given priority over a number of other bills from a very long list of legislation that this parliament is unlikely to deal with before the election is called. And some of those bills are important. For example, there is legislation on our books about money laundering that I doubt we will get to deal with-that is, measures designed to combat terrorism by cutting off the funds for criminal and terrorist organisations. There is a bill that we should be debating on improvements to the Australian passport system. That does not have priority before the parliament today. That is designed, as is the anti-money laundering bill, to ensure the security of our borders and our nation, something that the Prime Minister wants to campaign on in the media and with the public. But here, where it matters, he does not provide any priority for those bills to come before the parliament and rather brings forward a piece of legislation that is more about the games of politics than about any serious issue of substance. I commented before that the total number of same-sex marriages recognised at law in Australia today is zero. That stems from the existing act and the common law. Australia's common law is based on the British determinations in the 19th century. Those determinations include that by Lord Penzance, who in 1866 said: That definition has held pretty constant since then. When this parliament first looked to legislate in this area in its 1961 debate, the question was also raised about defining marriage in the act. In fact, the act did not define marriage, as such. The common-law definition was regarded as appropriate. At that time there was an amendment moved which sought to insert the words: That is effectively the same wording as the common law decision from 1866, repeated nearly 100 years later in 1961 in an amendment in the Senate. Under a Liberal government, that amendment was defeated in the Senate by 40 votes to eight. The Liberal senator who had carriage of the matter in the Senate was one John Gorton, later to become Prime Minister. He commented in relation to these matters: That was the view of the Menzies government. It is strange that our Prime Minister, who likes to model himself on old Ming, has chosen on this occasion to depart from 140 years of common-law practice and the views of a former Liberal government. It is also interesting that both of those definitions, including the one from 1961, refer not just to the union of a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all others, but to `for life'. I notice that is a convenient omission by a number of people on the other side of the chamber when they debate this now. Apparently for them marriage is not defined as something that is `for life'; I have heard nary a word of it. In fact, when the first speaker on the government benches omitted it I took the opportunity to interject, asking the question. The government member decided, obviously, not to respond. I suppose that is because, when you look at the statistics, sadly it is a reality that a very high proportion of marriages end in divorce. In 2001, the last year for which figures are available, there were 55,300 divorces. I have listened to people on the other side talk about how marriage provides stability, and I think that has a degree of truth in it. But the facts make clear that that is not so for many Australians. I think I am in a minority in this place, probably in a number of respects but in particular in terms of this debate. I am very happily married. I am not divorced or separated and not in my second marriage or my third. I am in my first marriage and I have been very happily married to the same person for more than 30 years. So I suspect I am in something of a minority. One of my colleagues suggested that, if we were fair dinkum in this debate, given some of the hubris we have heard, maybe we should say that the only people who can speak and vote on this debate are those people who are in fact in a marriage and have been able to establish that marriage for some length of time. If you listened to some of the rhetoric of people in this debate, you would think there is a great deal of mystery about the institution of marriage-and I guess in some respects there is. One of the things that has struck me in this debate as someone who has been very happily married to one person for 30 years is that the thing that establishes that loving relationship is not gender and is not sexuality. Love, respect and tolerance for one another and honesty with one another are keys to that lasting loving partnership. I know a number of people, people I have worked with and people who are friends of mine, who are gays and lesbians in longstanding relationships who I believe have that same love and respect and tolerance and open honesty with one another that I identify in my relationship with my wife. It is a pity that they have been drawn into this vortex of politics of division; this vortex of divide and conquer. The Prime Minister has very effectively over the years adopted the Bismarck approach to foreign policy: you divide your enemies and then you seek to conquer them. The Prime Minister has been good at that. He was pretty good at that internally within the Liberal Party. He has demonstrated as Prime Minister that he is pretty good at doing the same thing to the Australian population. That is the game that is being played here. Sadly, those people in Australia who are gay or lesbian or in same-sex relationships find themselves dragged into this debate as victims of this political charade. Those people I know who are gay and lesbian have not raised with me as an issue their desire to be married. It is not something that is high on their agenda, it seems to me. They do expect to have respect; they do expect to be free from persecution; they do expect to have the same rights as other people in a relationship. But the actual institution of marriage is not an issue that has been something that they have pursued with me over the years I have been involved with that community. However, what the Prime Minister has done by drawing them into this vortex is to say to them very publicly that their rights are to be demonstrably heralded as second class. The Prime Minister does that and gives this bill priority over far more important pieces of legislation that do affect our lives-indeed, affect our national security-because he and this government believe there is some short-term political benefit they can gain from it. It is obvious so far that that has not been the case, but it is a mark of the low level of public life that this government exhibit that they have been willing to play this card. When the Prime Minister made his announcement about these matters he referred to a package. That package included providing superannuation rights to same-sex couples. Unlike every other piece of the announcement, this one area did in fact impact on people's lives. The other things that are in the bill will have little or no practical effect on the daily lives of anybody. There are not people lining up to get married in same-sex relationships. There are none at law in Australia at the moment. It is pretty much the same thing when it comes to overseas adoption by same-sex couples. I would be interested to know if the minister for immigration or somebody could actually tell us how many same-sex couples have adopted children from overseas. The number would be very small-if indeed there are any.  But there is one thing of concrete reality, and that is that today people in same-sex relationships are discriminated against when their superannuation entitlements are determined. If a superannuant dies, the beneficiary should be their partner. But same sex couples are not necessarily accorded the rights which would apply were they heterosexual partners. That is wrong. The Labor Party has tried to correct that and, as the member for Grayndler has said, on 21 occasions he has introduced a private member's bill to correct that problem. The Prime Minister in the public relations exercise for this matter sought to put a sugar coating on the pill by saying that he would legislate to correct that problem. In fact, he has not. There is nothing in the bill before the parliament to correct that discrimination against same-sex couples, nothing at all. So of all of the things the Prime Minister indicated he would pursue in relation to this matter, he has pursued all of the ones that are political wedges but do not in fact alter the operation of the law of the land. But the one thing that would have changed the law to the benefit of same-sex couples he has not brought forward. That is the level of hypocrisy that the government has displayed in this matter. That is the duplicity. That is the dishonesty. I have a view that this bill could sit around and wait until the government brings in the legislation to provide same-sex couples equal rights at superannuation. Then we will vote on it. That would suit me fine. But clearly the parliament is not going to hold up this bill and play John Howard's game of wedge politics. However, the one reform that should be here is not here. Just this last sitting fortnight Labor again sought to have its private member's bill to correct that anomaly introduced into the parliament and the government voted it down again. The government have in fact used their numbers to prevent this parliament debating and voting on the elimination of that discrimination on a number of occasions over the course of the 21 times that the member for Grayndler has introduced the private member's bill into the parliament. The member for Grayndler deserves to be congratulated firstly for writing the private member's bill and presenting it and secondly for his tenacity in not letting things go. This bill will no doubt pass the chamber. It will go, I suspect, to a Senate inquiry. I imagine there will be a number of people from the public on all sides of the argument who would want to make submissions to that inquiry. I would urge all the people with an interest in this matter, though, to step back and look at the bigger political picture of which this is a small part. The bigger political picture of which this is a small part is that we have at the moment a desperate government and a desperate Prime Minister seeking any means by which they can cling to authority, including by dividing the population and setting Australian against Australian. It is well past the time when that sort of politics should be behind us. Instead of this parliament in its final weeks devoting hours of debate to this matter, we should be putting in place a more secure passport system-the legislation for which is in the line waiting outside this door. We should be putting in place legislation to fix the corruption in the financial system. That is probably not going to get here either. These are the things that the Australian people deserve to have their parliament dealing with, not the games that the Prime Minister has played here. This is a shameful exercise that the government has engaged in in this debate.  I wonder how members opposite can rationalise their involvement in this. We are all politicians and we know there is an election around the corner, but I really do wonder how some members opposite-who have, I think, quite genuine personal liberal views about these matters-can lie in bed at night and go to sleep having been a party to these games. It is a shameful exercise, and the government should be condemned for the way in which it has played politics over this issue. I say to the in excess of 500 same-sex couples in my electorate-who identify themselves as such in the ABS survey-that I look forward to the opportunity to talk to them about these matters. I look forward to the day when they do not have to find themselves being some sort of political football in games like this where government leaders, instead of leading and uniting the nation, seek to divide it and attack minority groups as this bill does."
13238,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Bruce Scott,1,NATS,Maranoa,4," This bill seeks to amend the Marriage Act 1961 to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. Whilst these words represent the current as well as the historical legal understanding of marriage in Australian law, it is important that the formal definition in the legislation will govern all marriages in Australia. I think historically we have seen marriage as being between a man and a woman. It is interesting that section 46(1) of the Marriage Act already requires that a marriage celebrant who is not a minister of a religion or a recognised denomination must say to the parties to a proposed marriage in the presence of the witness: I have had some people ring my office on that very point. These people were interested in the fact that, whilst we are bringing forward this legislation, marriage celebrants had already been required under the Marriage Act to use those words that we want to insert into the Marriage Act to ensure that that is the definition of marriage within Australia. I guess there are many of us in this place who understand that there are people of the same sex who seek to live together-and that is their wish. But I think it is of fundamental importance that, at a time when we live in a more globalised village, we know that if people of the same sex entered into a marriage situation under the law of another country, under our existing Australian laws, as I understand it, they would have been recognised in Australia. This bill will clarify the situation, and they will not be recognised under Australian law when this bill receives royal assent.  The important message that we send to the community is that we are supporting families and, importantly, we are supporting children. I think the basis of any successful nation is that the family is the rock on which we survive and, without that, the nation heads down into a situation of decay. The success of any community is strong family involvement in the community. By introducing this legislation, we are giving support to children and allowing them the opportunity to grow up with a mother and a father in their family. As the member for Brisbane said, not all marriages are happy and not all marriages are, as the Marriage Act says, entered into for life. I acknowledge that, but I think it is terribly important in the complex world in which we live that we give children the opportunity to grow up in a situation where they have a mother and a father. If we were to see a situation where people of the same sex were to marry overseas, under a law that we recognise in Australia and then come back to Australia to adopt children, that would send the wrong message across this nation and, importantly, to young children, who need guidance and the opportunity to grow up with a mother figure and a father figure and use them as role models for building their own lives. I would like to read into Hansard a couple of comments from letters from my constituents in Maranoa. One constituent said: I think this is the important comment. It is one that is reflected over and over by the people I have met, the people who have rung my office and the people I saw on my recent rounds in the western part of my electorate. The letter continues: Contrary to what the member for Brisbane may have been asserting, we have done this in the best interests of this nation. We have recently seen in the United States that certain states are allowing under their laws people of the same sex to be married. If Australians of the same sex travelled there and were married in those states that allowed it under their law, they would have been able to return to Australia and be considered as married under our existing law. That is what this legislation will address. I can ensure my constituents that what we are seeking to do will address that very issue. Another of my constituents said: Whilst I represent a very conservative electorate, I think those comments are reflected broadly across the community, and I certainly concur with them. The proposed amendment to the act will ensure that it is the parliament-and that is important-that determines the legal definition of marriage and that it will not be left to a court at some time in the future. It was one of my concerns-and I am sure that it is one of the government's real concerns-that, if we did not clarify this in law, perhaps at some time in the future we will see a court trying to determine this. We have seen this in a number of instances in the past. I think that, without this legislation, at some time in the future we could see a court determining that there could be marriage between same-sex couples. This will clarify the situation and make sure that the parliament is the determiner of the law regarding the marriage of two people. Marriage is a highly valued institution in Australia, and I am very proud to be part of a government that seeks to further preserve the sanctity of the union of marriage. The amendment reinforces the long-term nature of this government's commitment to marriage and guarantees that marriage will remain a stable institution and not a concept which, in a modern sense, can be updated or toyed with. The amendment has my strong support. I thank the parliament for the opportunity to speak on a very important piece of legislation which I know has overwhelming support across my constituency and, I suspect, the overwhelming support of the nation as a whole."
13239,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Michael Danby,1,ALP,Melbourne Ports,1," The Attorney-General told the House that the purpose of this bill is to give effect to the government's commitment to protect the institution of marriage. I think everyone understands that, by introducing such legislation only a few months before a federal election, the government is really trying to protect itself. It is trying to protect its hold on regional seats where it imagined it could exploit social issues like same-sex marriage to divert attention from its record in health, education, child care and aged care, which are the issues Australian families really care about. I do not believe that this bill responds to any real sentiment in the Australian community that the institutions of marriage and family need protecting against the `horrid spectre' of same-sex marriage. People in my electorate are asking, `Protect them against what?' I have yet to see any explanation of how discriminating against gay men and lesbians strengthens marriage or the family. Families in my electorate do not feel any threat from their gay and lesbian friends and neighbours. They rightly suspect that this bill is a stunt-a diversion from the issues that I have just mentioned, a diversion from this government's policies which really are damaging Australian families. Same-sex marriage is not currently recognised by Australian law. If the government's proposed amendment to the Marriage Act is passed, it will still not be recognised. In other words, the amendment will make no difference to Australian law. The only effect the bill has is to preclude the possibility that the courts may at some time in the future decide to overturn the current common law definition of marriage. Same-sex unions are, however, recognised in the American state of Massachusetts, in three Canadian provinces and in some European countries. No doubt this trend will continue. There is a possibility that Australian citizens in same-sex relationships could travel to these countries and be legally married there. They could then return to Australia and seek recognition of these marriages through the courts.  Over the past 20 years we have seen a great evolution in the Australian community's attitude towards marriage and the family. We have seen the widespread acceptance of divorce, of lone parents, of couples living together and having children without being formally married and of blended families. These things are now accepted by most Australians. Attitudes toward same-sex relationships have also changed. From being something that was kept secret, same-sex relationships are now widely accepted in the Australian community. Many well-known people in Australian public life, including members of this parliament, have same-sex partners. As a result, we have seen a process of removal of legal discrimination against same-sex couples in all of the Australian states and territories-even Tasmania-under governments of both political persuasions. In Victoria, we saw the Bracks government in its first term carry out a comprehensive reform of state law, which had the effect of putting same-sex relationships on the same legal footing as de facto heterosexual couples in all areas except adoption and access to artificial reproductive technology. These reforms did not happen by accident. Melbourne has a vibrant gay and lesbian community and a dedicated gay and lesbian rights movement. Many of its leaders live in or close to my electorate. Some of them live in the electorate of the member for Higgins, and I think he should pay more attention to them. That movement worked for many years to achieve legal quality at both state and federal levels. I want to acknowledge in this House the work of Jamie Gardiner, Chris Gill, David McCarthy, Lyn Morgain, Adam Pickvance and many others who have devoted so much time and effort to the advancement of their community and to persuading their friends, in a most intelligent, persistent and articulate way. As a result of their work in educating the Victorian community over a long period of time, the extensive changes which the Bracks government proposed met with almost no public opposition and were passed by a legislative council which at that time was controlled by the Liberal and National parties. We have seen similar changes of public attitudes in other states, most notably Tasmania. As a result of the work of the Tasmanian gay and lesbian rights movement-supported of course by many other people, such as the honourable member for Denison, who is owed great credit for the work he undertook there-there has been a revolution in attitudes in that state, where only a few years ago homosexual acts carried a penalty of 20 years in prison. Talk about going back to the days of Oscar Wilde. This brings me back to same-sex marriage. Five years ago this issue was not on the agenda of the gay and lesbian rights movement. Many gay and lesbian activists took the view that marriage was a heterosexual, indeed patriarchal, institution which gay men and lesbians should have nothing to do with. There was certainly no consensus that extending the definition of marriage to include same-sex relationships was a desirable thing or an objective which gay and lesbian rights movements should spend their time on. This has changed over the past few years, mainly as a result of the impact of events in the United States. There has always been more support in the American gay and lesbian community for same-sex marriage than there has been in Australia. Since marriage law in the US is decided at state level, liberal states such as Vermont and Massachusetts began to move towards changing their laws. The American Republican Party then decided to exploit this issue as a wedge against the Democrats, culminating in President Bush's suggestion of amending the US constitution to ban same-sex marriages and, indeed, all kinds of legal recognition for same-sex couples across the country. Same-sex marriage has thus become a hot-button political issue in the United States, perhaps as the Prime Minister and some elements in the government would like it to be in Australia. This is why the issue of same-sex marriage is being raised in Australia-because of the political flow-on effects, because some of the people who give the government political advice think this could be used as a wedge issue.  Just because an issue has been raised elsewhere, that does not mean it can or should be acted upon immediately. I do not believe that the Australian community is ready to see the definition of marriage change. This will not change until the gay and lesbian rights movement do the kind of educational work around this issue that they have successfully done around other issues over the past 35 years, starting with decriminalisation in the 1960s. It is not for me to tell the gay and lesbian community what their objectives should be. But, if they have now decided that same-sex marriage is a desirable objective, they need to persuade the Australian people of this. We are here to represent the people and, while we sometimes rightly seek to lead public opinion, I am not in favour of passing laws which the majority of the Australian people are not ready to accept-or not ready to accept yet-nor am I in favour of major changes to the law being brought about by the courts without the people being able to have a say. This just leads to populist resentment against elitist decision making which ignores public opinion. When the Australian people indicate that they are not opposed to the legal recognition of same-sex marriage, it will be time for their elected representatives in this parliament to change the law accordingly. But I have to say to my friends in the gay and lesbian community that we are not quite in that position yet. But the gay and lesbian community may yet have grounds to be grateful to the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, because they have now taken a non-issue and turned it into a real issue. The legal and civic status of same-sex couples is now being debated in the national parliament of Australia, in the media and, presumably, at barbeques all over Australia-weather permitting, of course, at this time of the year. Everybody can see how blatantly the government is appealing to prejudice in trying to use the bogey of same-sex marriage as an election wedge. Australians who did not previously support same-sex marriage may now reconsider, on the grounds that anything the Prime Minister or the government oppose so vehemently must have something going for it. Let us be clear: there has been no backflip or backdown by the Labor Party on this issue. The legal recognition of same-sex marriage is not Labor Party policy and never has been. The issue was fully debated at our national conference in January and our policy was reconfirmed. This has been our consistent position, as the government knows perfectly well. The government's proposed changes to the Family Law Act are another matter. They would have the effect of prohibiting same-sex couples from adopting children from overseas countries under any circumstances. This is in a different category to the amendments to the Marriage Act. While those changes are purely symbolic, the adoption issue affects the lives of real people, particularly children-for whom I would have thought all members of this House would have primary concern in issues like this, rather than try to make political issues out of them.  It is hard to see why this has suddenly become such an urgent issue that it requires legislation a few months or a few weeks before a federal election. Again the suspicion is raised that this is just another pre-election stunt designed to divide the community and arouse prejudice at a time when the government does not want the electorate thinking about the real issues on which the election will be fought. Adoption law has traditionally been a matter for the states and territories. Why has this suddenly become an issue for the federal government? What evidence is there that there is a significant issue with same-sex couples adopting children from overseas? The dominant consideration in relation to any adoption should be the welfare of the child. That is a matter that should be determined by the competent authorities, not imposed by a blanket prohibition by the government acting out of crude political self-interest. If it is in the best interests of a particular child that they be adopted by a same-sex couple, what right has the government to prohibit that? We will be opposing this provision in the government's bill. Finally, Labor will be voting in the Senate to refer this bill to a Senate inquiry. This will allow all sections of the community to have their say. I hope that this will advance community understanding of the issue of same-sex relationships and their place in the community. I urge everybody who has a stake in this issue to make a submission to that inquiry, which I believe would not have happened without the work of the opposition. In the recent media and community debate about this bill there has been almost no focus on the fact that the Howard government would also keep in place a range of other discriminatory laws. Labor has made a commitment to a comprehensive reform of Commonwealth laws for same-sex couples. This would involve an audit of all Commonwealth legislation. The purpose of the audit would be to identify where, amongst the thousands of pieces of Commonwealth legislation, discrimination against same-sex couples exists. Labor will then amend the legislation to remove such discrimination. Labor is also committed to introducing antivilification and antiharassment laws, as well as stronger protection against discrimination on the ground of sexuality. A re-elected Howard government would retain all of the discriminatory legislation and, as we see here today, would be prepared to introduce further discrimination, such as the prohibition of intercountry adoption by same-sex couples regardless of the interests of the children. It would be a blanket ban with no interpretation of individual circumstances, which I think is unconscionable. Labor have already identified the legislation requiring change, which includes the Workplace Relations Act, the Income Tax Act, superannuation laws, immigration and citizenship laws, the Social Security Act and Defence Force legislation, and we expect that there will be many more pieces of law that will need to be amended once the full audit is completed. I know that some of my constituents are disappointed that the opposition are not opposing the amendments to the Marriage Act, although they have welcomed our opposition to the government's interference in adoption law and the prospect of a Senate inquiry into all aspects of the issues raised by the legislation. I know they will also welcome the fact that the Labor Party are committed to delivering wide-ranging same-sex law reform. At some stage I will be moving amendments that are particularly dear to my heart. Since I became a member of this parliament, the member for Grayndler, Mr Albanese, and I have been insisting that the government pass same-sex superannuation laws, and we are going to call on this government to stand and deliver. When the government first foreshadowed this legislation they made a great deal of the fact that they were going to amend the superannuation provisions to allow same-sex couples and various other categories of couples to pass their superannuation on to each other. They have advanced the wedge legislation, but there is no sign of the superannuation equality part of this legislation. We are going to ask this government to drop its political hypocrisy and show some fair standards. I used to think that the Liberal party was the party of property and would insist that people who had accumulated savings, wealth and property be entitled to pass them on to any person that they determined. In my view this is a great piece of hypocrisy which this parliament has allowed to exist for too many years. We still do not see any evidence of the government coming up with the amendments on superannuation that would resolve this issue. A divisive political issue has been advanced but there are none of the proposed amendments on superannuation. I have outlined the Labor Party's attitude to marriage and to the adoption provisions and I will be appearing later in this debate to make it clear that we are going to hold the government to account on the issue of delivering on superannuation for same-sex couples."
13240,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Alan Cadman,1,LP,Mitchell,2," The Labor Party wants to go into all sorts of ramifications about the bill and the definition that we are looking at today. I would be very interested if the member for Lowe endorsed the remarks of the previous speaker, but he must go along with the proposal to comb through legislation should the Labor Party come to government and remove what is described as discrimination. This legislation just proposes to insert in the Marriage Act the words: The reason that this needs to be done is that the courts in Massachusetts in the United States, in Canada and in other parts of the world have chosen to give a definition to marriage which is different to the one that the government have put forward. The Australian government are saying that we believe that the understood definition should stand and that we do not want courts changing that definition, because that creates confusion. It does not create discrimination; it creates confusion. The relationship between men and women is usually for children and the advantages of that stable environment for young lives are demonstrated time and time again. There have been speakers today who have tried to suggest that the worst possible situation in which a person could live is that of a family. That is absolute nonsense. Every study and every piece of documentation presented to us in the House of Representatives Family and Community Affairs Committee indicated that the safest place for children is with their biological parents. The least damage-socially, mentally or physically-is done to children when they are with their biological parents. When there is a non-biological parent present that is when the risk factors start to rise. Biological parents look after and safeguard their children-both fathers and mothers. They look after their kids, they love and cherish their kids and time and time again it has been proven that the safest place for children to be is with their biological parents. But there seems to be an argument in society that it is a dangerous or unsafe thing for children to be with their families. My colleague across the chamber, the member for Batman, can shrug, but the fact is that one of your own speakers advanced that argument earlier this evening, denigrating the fact that children should be in a stable relationship with their biological parents. The advantages of that to society have been documented time and time again. Somebody that you would not think would necessarily advance these thoughts, because of the time she has been through, is Hilary Clinton. In her book It Takes a Village she observed: In Australia, the social researcher Moira Eastman, in examining the claims of the American sociologist Jessie Bernard, said: So it is a unique and different relationship that we are seeking to define today. It is not a relationship that we are seeking to change; it is a relationship we are seeking to perpetuate, and it is a relationship that I seek to encourage. I have done some studies to try to measure what the marriage processes have created. I have to say that information about the disadvantages or advantages of marriage is not as readily available in Australia as in the United States. But Barry Maley, writing on divorce law and the future of marriage, has written in CIS policy monograph 58, 2003: and I think he is referring to the definition and living arrangements that we are discussing today- So the conclusion that Bettina Arndt and the Institute of Family Studies came to is that the married relationship is a very significant factor in the stability of children's lives. That is why it was established; it was established and named `marriage' for that purpose. It does not mean just any relationship between a man and a woman or any other group. As the classical and traditional definition says, and as it says here in the bill: I would add, `and usually for bringing children into the world'. So the researchers indicate that marriage is a very safe place for children and children fare better in a marriage environment than anywhere else. The process of deciding that children can be moved around between families is something that the parliament is struggling with currently, with changes to the Family Law Act on the non-custodial parent issue. That is something that is before the parliament now. The research that has come from that study and that wide-reaching inquiry strongly endorses the fact that, where it can be achieved, the stability of marriage promotes greater health, greater stability and a greater sense of achievement for men and women and for the children involved. I do believe that, in this discussion before the House, saying it is a discriminatory process to define marriage is nothing but a furphy and we should ignore it. The Labor Party cast strange words around in their proposed amendment to this bill, on the grounds of sexuality. That has got nothing to do with what is before the House. What is before the House is the issue of what marriage does mean; if we are clear on that, we can call other relationships anything we like. But I think that, for the sake of children and for the sake of the future of this country, we have to be very sure of what we mean by `marriage'. It is a man and a woman for life, to the exclusion of others, and it is for bringing children into the world-and to me that is the most critical factor in this whole argument. The adventurous judges of the northern hemisphere could create problems in Australia. If a couple have married overseas-and we normally recognise marriages of all countries of the world, whatever form those marriages may take-and declare themselves to be married, we normally accept that. But in this instance there are some countries that have changed what we consider to be the definition of marriage. So this legislation will guide the courts in determining what it is that Australians regard as, and wish to have determined as, marriage. What we are really saying to judges is that if somebody should arrive in Australia claiming to be married and they are married to somebody of the same sex then, under Australian law, that is not a marriage. A marriage should only be between a man and a woman, to the exclusion of others, and preferably for life. I think that everybody in this House has experienced unexpected shocks and surprises when judges have gone off and done things that are completely beyond the realm of this parliament's consideration-not to the wild extent of the American Supreme Court, where they may in fact invent law, but we have had some unusual decisions. Some have been helpful in clarifying the law, but some have been law making. I do not care how much I may be in dispute in this place with my colleagues opposite or those on the same side. It is our responsibility to make laws that are as clear as possible, to clearly set out for judges and for courts what the Australian people expect us to do and what they expect their laws to mean. If we cannot get it right, it is not the role of the courts to interpret. This is one instance where the government have said-and, I believe, rightly; the Prime Minister has been right from day one when he first raised this issue-we need to be sure that we do not get into a mix-up in trying to determine what marriage is because a court has made a pre-emptive strike. We need to be clear in our own minds what we mean by `marriage', and the definition of marriage, I am pleased to say, in subsection 5(1) of this bill amending the Marriage Act 1961, is this: "
13241,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Martin Ferguson,1,ALP,Batman,1," The Prime Minister was at long last driven by the will of the community to fix the blatant discrimination inherent in our superannuation laws. He was driven to concede that gays and lesbians should have the right to nominate the beneficiary of their own hard-earned and accumulated superannuation. I commend him for finally relenting on this issue, albeit a relenting that was long overdue. But I also suggest to the House that, having made that concession, the Prime Minister was so petty and small-minded that he could not make that reform without soothing his own moral conservatism. The Prime Minister could not make a progressive reform for our gay and lesbian Australians without giving them a commensurate kick in the guts. I think it is about time we accepted that gay and lesbian relationships should be recognised. I take this opportunity as an elected representative of the Australian people to condemn the government for this regressive and unnecessary legislation. I condemn the Prime Minister for not bringing forward a constructive package of reforms for the gay and lesbian community in Australia. In the same way that gay and lesbians now have the right to bequeath their superannuation funds to their partner, so should we move forward legal and community recognition of their relationships. That is an issue that calls for leadership and bipartisanship to remove discrimination, create equal rights and responsibilities and move on to fix problems that genuinely concern Australians. Modern Australia in the 21st century has moved on beyond the gutter politics of the Prime Minister. Do not just think about the bill before the House but think about the motivation of the Prime Minister who brought the bill before the House. I say that because I genuinely believe that Australians in the 21st century do not want a community where the state is peering into bedroom windows, judging the behaviour and free choices of consenting adults. Australians would prefer to see the time and resources of their government spent on fixing problems and healing division, not creating and fuelling them. This bill enshrines the common law position that the institution of marriage is reserved for heterosexuals, but let us be honest: the bill will have no practical effect on our daily lives except that it acts as a political tool for the Prime Minister to exploit differences and forge division in the Australian community. The bill and all its intended publicity sends the message to gays and lesbians that the law and society will not recognise their relationships under the institution of marriage or under-and this is an important point-any alternative legal or social framework or structure. That is something that ought to be explored.  To leave this void saddens me. It saddens me because I cannot fathom a reason to continue to deny rights, in whatever form, to decent Australians who are merely after a fair go and a sense of recognition. Australians in same-sex relationships lead normal, regular lives and want to be treated that way by all their fellow citizens. They are not asking for special treatment. In fact, their campaign is simple-it is similar to campaigns that have been pursued by a lot of other groups throughout the history of the Australian parliament. It is simply about removing and avoiding special treatment. Gay and lesbian Australians want to live their lives as valued Australian citizens and to be criticised against the same criteria as all other Australians. That is a fair request in a modern society. I believe that sooner rather than later we as a community and as legislators must cut down the straw men and afford rights and responsibilities to all partnerships, not just straight partnerships as the Prime Minister would define them. In that regard, the work of the Tasmanian and Australian Capital Territory parliaments must be commended by this House, but other parliaments, including our own national parliament, must start to think about biting the bullet and removing discrimination in all its forms against gay and lesbian Australians. I very much agree that a majority of Australians believe that families are a key fabric of our stable society, but we also have an obligation as members of Australian society to wake up and smell the roses. Australian families come in a massive range of shapes, sizes and constructs. A broad and diverse range of family circumstances is a fact of life and is widely accepted in the Australian community today. It is about time we understood that society today is very complex. Perhaps there are some who have an ideal model in their minds, but who are they, or we, to judge that families that differ from that mould are less valuable, less legitimate or un-Australian? To do so unfairly and illegitimately condemns people on the basis of their personal circumstances. I believe that it is an ignorant stance that causes unnecessary pain to fellow Australians. Loving, respectful relationships and families are to be recognised, valued and celebrated. Sexual preference should not be a ground to deny that celebration and acceptance. There is clearly something very wrong with a society that turns a blind eye and rejects a union on those grounds alone. I also believe that we as a community must accept that we suffer by not being inclusive and by not being tolerant of others. Therefore, this evening I also call for more acceptance and inclusiveness in our views of parenthood. Parents have a great responsibility to their children to love, nurture, educate and develop them to be great people, great citizens and respectable contributors to the society that we live in-to do the best that they can within their means and circumstances, which are very varied in Australian society, to assist others in the community. I can attest that, along with those responsibilities, parents receive a great learning and pleasure from the experience of parenthood. Yes, it is exceptionally difficult to be a parent, but it is a wonderful opportunity. I therefore also believe that to adopt children is a very big decision for anyone to make. The state has a great responsibility to protect the interests of children by ensuring that adoptive parents have the means and the wherewithal to meet the needs and aspirations of those children. Australian legislators therefore have a fundamental obligation to ensure that the checks, balances and tests to protect these children are rigorous in ensuring that adoptive parents can provide the best opportunity for the children's development. There are many criteria, but it is not a straightforward checklist. It is a highly skilled task to match children with parents and it is best left to the experts. But I am concerned that one criterion on that list must not stand alone, and that is the sexuality of the parent or parents. In my mind, if all things are equal-and that is what that means: they are equal-it means that there should be no room for an unsubstantiated bias, which is really what is in the mind of the Prime Minister and those who support him with the bill before the House this evening. To me, it is unconscionable in a situation where couples A and B have each been assessed to be fully capable, competent and prepared to responsibly care for a child to then say that couple B will be better parents because they are `straight' in the mind of the Prime Minister. Witnessing such blatant discrimination and ignorance offends me to the core and, as far as I am concerned, it is not the Australian way. It is really about the Prime Minister's desire and the nature of wedge politics to demonise the gay and lesbian community in Australia. I simply say that gays and lesbians are part of Australian society. They are represented in the highest court in Australia. They are represented in the Australian parliament. They look after us from birth to death. They teach our children. They are in all aspects of Australian society because they are part of what makes up the Australian family. I think it is about time that, on behalf of the gay and lesbian community, this parliament said it is sick and tired of them being demonised by people who are not prepared to come to terms with the nature of Australian society in the 21st century. That is what this debate is about today. It is about wedge politics and a further opportunity for the Prime Minister and the small band of intolerant people who stand with him to demonise the gay and lesbian community. Australian gays and lesbians, whether in relationships or not, should not have been subject to this premeditated act of bigotry from the Prime Minister of Australia. If the Prime Minister and his inner court of social conservatives want to confront their feelings of hatred and intolerance of difference, they should confront them in private and within themselves and not seek to impose that view on the Australian society generally. We as a community have to continue to move forward. For our success on the multiculturalism front we are held in high regard in the international community, because we move forward and embrace many people from different countries and cultures. In the same vein, it is about time that the legislators in this nation accept that the Australian community needs to keep moving forward towards a more tolerant, diverse and respectful community with respect to the issues before the House this evening. This is about leadership, and that is what the Australian community is expecting from us as legislators in debates concerning the matters before the House this evening. It has to be about an open, constructive dialogue-dialogue on areas of law that single out particular groups in consideration of any legitimate grounds for that different treatment. Surely we are mature enough as a nation to engage in discussion, in a progressive way, to move to foster mutual understanding of difference and further promote families and relationships that further bond our community and strengthen society and community in Australia. But I contend to the House this evening that is not what this bill is about. It is fundamentally opposed to that approach to life. It is fundamentally opposed to what is acceptable in any fair-minded society. I say in conclusion that only a short time ago the AttorneyGeneral stood in this House and said the following with respect to the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004:  I simply say that the AttorneyGeneral and the Prime Minister must mix in different circles to the circles that I mix in. He then said: What a load of codswallop. Where is the `significant concern' in the Australian community? It does not come up in the street talks that I have regularly in my electorate. People there are more concerned with talking about health, education, the lack of apprenticeship opportunities and the cost of living. The marriage act is never raised in those community consultations. Where is the demonstrated need to act so quickly that has motivated the Prime Minister to bring this bill before the House? I am pleased to say that I represent a diverse electorate: the electorate of Batman. It is diverse in age, gender, ethnicity, sexual preference, incomes, ambitions and aspirations. But there is one thing that the electorate of Batman believes in, and that is tolerance and a fair go-which is completely contrary to the intent of the bill before the House this evening. There has been no rush to my office to express concern about the possible imminent erosion of marriage in Australia. I am one of the few members in this House who regularly travels the length and breadth of the country in my capacity as shadow minister for transport, infrastructure, urban and regional development. During those visits and community consultations I meet with a range of people from a variety of backgrounds in those communities. Never in any of those consultations has there been, as the Prime Minister would have us believe, a growing, imminent fear that the institution of marriage is under attack from gays and lesbians married in other countries or from those choosing to adopt children. Where are the examples, Mr Prime Minister, Mr Attorney-General? Where are they evidenced in your so-called community consultations? But I tell you what I do hear. I hear the concern that families are struggling because services are continually being eroded, our health system is falling apart, our schools do not have the resources they need, our kids cannot get apprenticeships, and our kids cannot afford to go to universities. They are the issues confronting and undermining Australian families-the pressures and stresses of life. That is what is destroying partnerships and marriages in Australia, not a so-called attack on the Marriage Act in Australia in the 21st century. This debate does nothing about helping those families and the institution of marriage in Australia. In no way will it protect the sanctity of marriage at all. Let us be honest: when we look at legislation we should never just look at the bill before the House and the second reading speech that is associated with that bill. We have to look at the motivation that led to that bill and that second reading speech. In conclusion this evening, I simply say that the intent of this bill is to attack the gay and lesbian community in Australia, to demonise them and to say to them all that they are second-class citizens in what we fundamentally believe to be a modern, tolerant, forward looking Australian community. I say to our gay and lesbian friends, our colleagues, yes, our neighbours, and the people with whom we sit in the Australian parliament, that to score political points off the back of political division is un-Australian. The Prime Minister must be smarting at his wedge work. All I can say is that I am ashamed of the Prime Minister, and I am ashamed of the motivation that brought this bill before the House. It is about time that this House adopted the intent of the second reading amendment moved by the member for Gellibrand, which is that it is our responsibility as a national parliament to commit ourselves to finally removing all forms of discrimination against same-sex couples in Australia. (Time expired)"
13242,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,David Hawker,1,LP,Wannon,4," I do support this bill and I think it is worth just going back to the speech made by the Attorney-General when he introduced the legislation. I certainly supported him when he said: He went on to speak of `the fundamental importance of the place of marriage in our society'. He said: Those points really do sum up why this is necessary, and it is very important to emphasise them. Marriage is a central and fundamental institution. The place that marriage holds in our society is of fundamental importance, and I think it is important that we reinforce that basis. As the Attorney-General went on to say, that basis is this: I think that is a very important point that seems to be overlooked when others are trying to create division. It is interesting that opposition members have been trying to raise what the vast majority want. When you listen to some of the speakers you would think that the vast majority have a very different view. However, a research note that came from the Parliamentary Library talked about the question of same-sex couples. I certainly do not have any problem with same-sex couples; they do not concern or worry me at all, but we are talking about very small numbers. As has been pointed out, almost two-thirds of the electoral divisions in the federal parliament have less than a hundred same-sex couples, according to the 2001 census. I note that in my electorate of Wannon, for example, there are 36 same-sex couples. I have no problem with that but I do not think that we should try to pretend that this is a large number of people who are somehow being singled out, because I do not think they are. I believe that Australia is a much more tolerant society today than it was a few decades ago, and we do recognise a range of relationships. I would be the first to say that I think that is fine, but I do not think that it means that we therefore have to change what we believe is the definition of marriage. When we talk about tolerance, it is very interesting to see that some sections of the community do not want to display the same level of tolerance that I think just about everyone in this chamber would. I will quote from an article that appeared in the Australian in May, headed `No hatred in keeping marriage laws sacred'. It says: It goes on: I do not know; it is a free society and people ought to be able to express a point of view. Whether you agree or disagree, you have got the right to say so. It goes on to point out the obvious: I think that is an important point. When the lobbyists who are trying to push an alternative point of view claim vilification, as has been pointed out in this article, we have really got to see what their motive is. The article goes on: I do not share that view. It continues: What is the obvious? The obvious is, despite all the problems and the faults that everyone can see: That puts it very simply and clearly. I think that, rather than toying about with ideals, we need to talk about reality and what we basically know in our own hearts is still the truth. The article goes on: I do not think that has ever been doubted, and I will say that you could always find exceptions. We all know we can find exceptions, but that does not alter the fact that this is an ideal that holds up against alternatives. Again, I agree with the article when it says: That is really what this debate is about, and I think we have got to come back to that point. Everyone loves to talk about rights, but they are not so quick to talk about responsibilities these days. The article goes on: That question hangs on those who want to argue against this piece of legislation. I challenge them to try to find the answer to that, because I am not sure that they have one. I think that their position changes according to the argument they want to muster, and in this case it is one that tries to avoid that question. I come back to the point which I think is quite critical and central to this debate. The article concludes: And I think that is really what so many of the alternative views that are being put in this debate are about. They are not saying it in so many words, but they are trying to argue the question of moral relativism. I think that is wrong and it comes back to the basic point: the reason for this bill is to reaffirm what marriage is, but it is also, most importantly, to recognise that marriage is and has been the cornerstone of the society that we all value so much. If we devalue that cornerstone then, over time, we run a very real risk of undermining the very society that we all value so much. That is why this bill is so important. It is also very important to restate that marriage as defined in this bill, whatever its faults and for all the problems that people can identify-and we have all seen them first-hand on many occasions-is still the best way to raise children. There are examples around the world where alternatives have been tried, and I do not think that, over time, those alternatives stack up as superior. I support this bill. I believe it is important. As I said earlier, it is very important that the parliament, as the elected representatives of the people of Australia, define quite clearly what we mean by marriage and legislate accordingly and that we do not leave it to appointed but not elected members of the judiciary to choose to make a definition which may change over time. Therefore, I commend the bill to the House. Before I conclude, let me say I looked at the amendment put forward by the member for Gellibrand and I find quite extraordinary the arguments she has had to muster to put forward her amendment. In the first part, she talks about `unjust interference by the Commonwealth' in an area regulated by the states in relation to intercountry adoption. I thought that was weird. That is complete nonsense. Since when should the states be overriding the national parliament when it comes to matters relating to international law? It goes on. There is a claim about Labor's: This bill does nothing to accept, condone or in any way allow discrimination or vilification. Again, the sorts of points that are being made in this amendment really are just nonsense and demonstrate the paucity of argument that has been put forward by the opposition. So I have much pleasure in supporting this bill and I commend it to the House."
13243,2004-06-16,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Brendan O'Connor,1,ALP,Burke,4," This bill has been introduced into the parliament in order to divide the community. It should be noted from the beginning that loving relationships take many forms. No discrimination should exist under Commonwealth law, or any law, to any relationship, be it a marriage, a de facto heterosexual relationship or a same-sex relationship. It should also be recognised that this bill has not been introduced to celebrate the institution of marriage. As I said earlier, the bill has been introduced to divide Australians. It is a quite tragic and brutal furphy contrived by the Prime Minister. There has not been any outcry in the community. There have not been any judicial determinations that have led to the introduction of this bill. This bill recognises an institution already recognised by existing law. It is a superfluous bill, intended to vilify a significant minority of community members. I have listened to a number of speakers, certainly those on this side, and I think it is fair to say-and I think most people, if they were honest with themselves, would agree-that society has evolved. Relationships and the definition of relationships have evolved. The law has sometimes moved ahead of society, but rarely. The fact is that in this area the law seems to follow public opinion and what is acceptable to the community. I think it is fair to say that public opinion with respect to what marriage is and who is an appropriate partner has changed. It has changed very dramatically in my lifetime. Less than a couple of generations ago, a mixed marriage, if it was defined as such, would be between a heterosexual couple, one of whom might be a Catholic and the other a Protestant. They were believers in the same God but of different denominations. I can recall people talking about the unacceptable union of two heterosexual people who believe in the same God but are of different denominations. Somehow, that union was not acceptable to many people-not only people from those particular religious institutions but also people from outside those two Christian groups. Since two generations ago, the community has rejected the idea that two people, a man and a woman, from different denominations of Christianity should not marry. Indeed, the bitter sectarianism that used to exist has, thankfully, dissipated and all but disappeared. One generation ago the community acceptance of de facto heterosexual relationships was equivocal to say the least. It is hard to imagine now, but if you go back to the early eighties it was not acceptable in company, certainly amongst many people, to talk about people living together as an acceptable arrangement. That too has gone by the wayside, thankfully. The fact is that now the majority of people who enter a relationship commence that relationship on a de facto basis, and many maintain that de facto status indefinitely. That has now become a very acceptable relationship, one that most people tolerate. And I am not talking about the inner suburbs of the capital cities of Australia, what I suppose those opposite might term the bohemian enclaves of inner suburbia. I am talking about the outer suburbs, the regional towns and the regional communities where de facto relationships are acceptable. I know that there would be sons and daughters and, indeed, other relatives of members opposite who would be living in de facto relationships-which would be accepted, as they should be, as relationships. If I can digress for one moment and make reference to an earlier speaker's comment on the rearing of children, I do not accept that the situation is necessarily that it is important that a child's parents be married. The best situation for a child being reared by adults is for those adults to be in a loving relationship. Formal state recognition of the relationship, even if that is indeed the preference of most, should not be first and foremost; rather, the household should be filled with love and care for those children. I would certainly rather see children raised in a loving and caring de facto relationship than a dysfunctional marriage. Anybody who is honest with themselves and honest with us in this place would articulate that view. The fact is, we have moved on. Society has moved on and has accepted relationships. Indeed, I should not just refer to marriage between Catholic and Protestants. What were more controversial at one time were interracial relationships and marriages. Again, that is a blight on our history, no doubt, but there has been an evolution in people's tolerance and understanding and in what is acceptable to the community. Many relationships that were interracial in nature were not acceptable to many people. Indeed, as we know, in many sovereign states they were not acceptable under law. So we have seen many forms of discrimination, both in terms of the law and perhaps also in terms of community acceptance. I use those other forms of relationships to draw an analogy to something that is becoming increasingly acceptable to the Australian people. I refer to same-sex couples. The fact is, like interracial relationships and like de facto heterosexual relationships, same-sex relationships are becoming increasingly acceptable to Australians. And that is a positive thing. What is happening here, unfortunately, is that we have a Prime Minister who does not accept the trend. That is not unusual for him. It is also not unusual for the Prime Minister to find reason to create a divide within our community. Unfortunately, what has occurred since the introduction of this bill has been an outcry by the gay and lesbian community, who are concerned that they are being targeted and discriminated against. It also has raised concerns in people in general, who wonder why the Prime Minister and this government spend more time playing politics with people's private lives than dealing with the public need for better education and better access to health services-those fundamental things people expect government to deal with. The fact that the Prime Minister has decided to do this says a number of things about him as a character. As I have indicated, it is a sanctimonious and bigoted form of expression, if you like, to introduce this bill for the reasons it has been introduced. It also shows that the government lacks an agenda and is unable to focus on the things that Australians want their government to focus upon. So on one hand it is a sign of bigotry; on the other it is a sign of the desperation of a government that lacks ideas and lacks the wherewithal to fix many of the problems that exist out in the real world. I live in and represent an electorate that is a cross-section of the Australian community. It has rural and suburban parts to it. I have never had, in all of the conversations and contacts and correspondence with constituents through my office, a local constituent raise with me concerns about the issue of the institution of marriage being undermined by some subversive plan of anybody's. If we listen closely we might be able to hear something. I believe the Prime Minister is blowing a dog whistle for certain sections of the community. This is not about restating what we know the institution of marriage to be. This is about looking to divide the community. It is also important that we look at some of the areas of discrimination that same-sex couples suffer. I suppose if there is one silver lining to this cloud, it is that in raising this matter in this way we get a chance to focus on some of these areas of discrimination. It is important therefore to focus on the amendment moved by the member for Gellibrand, in which Labor has committed to taking a strong stand against discrimination on grounds of sexuality. Indeed, as the second paragraph of the amendment indicates, Labor will commit to an audit of all Commonwealth legislation in order to remove any areas of discrimination. If we look at some of them we should be a little alarmed. Most people would be alarmed to know what is denied partners in a same-sex relationship. For example, a partner in a same-sex relationship may be denied the right to: make medical decisions on a partner's behalf when he or she is sick, or to even visit the partner or partner's child in hospital; take bereavement or sick leave to care or mourn for a partner; share equal rights and equal responsibilities for children in their care; have their partner covered under their health or employment benefits; apply for immigration and residency if their partner is from another country; inherit from a deceased partner if he or she were intestate; choose a partner's final resting place; or obtain pension benefits if their partner dies. They are just some of the deficiencies in the law that do not make it clear whether partners in longstanding same-sex relationships are given the same rights as those given to partners in other relationships. I think it is time to look as closely as we can at the Commonwealth laws in order to rectify those levels of discrimination. It is not acceptable, in my view-and indeed in Labor's view-that we go on accepting that if you are in a same-sex relationship you do not have basic rights. It is important to note, as members have already indicated, the effort by the member for Grayndler, who introduced a private member's bill, and has been on the record for a long time, in support of same-sex couples being entitled to superannuation benefits. His private member's bill should have been accepted by the government. What is telling about this debate is that the government did foreshadow that it was interested in looking at rectifying the deficiency in relation to superannuation, but there is no mention of superannuation in this bill. Indeed, if the government were genuine about wanting to ensure that marriage was defined as being between a man and woman-and restate that, as I think has been accepted-and at the same time wanting to look at removing at least some areas of discrimination in relation to same-sex relationships, it would have incorporated provisions that would have removed discrimination in the area of superannuation. That has not happened, so we can only conclude that there is no genuine intention to arrest an unfortunate set of laws that deprive partners in same-sex relationships of what could be their retirement benefits. I therefore found the words of the Prime Minister to be false and empty when he said that he was looking to restate marriage as an institution between a man and a woman and to find the means to remove these areas of superannuation. The bona fides of those intentions should be found in the provisions of this bill, but they are nowhere to be found. I think it is very hurtful, on the one hand, to focus on this significant minority and vilify and demonise their relationships and them as individuals-in many ways that is probably the worst thing-and, on the other hand, to give partners in same-sex relationships the hope that they no longer have to suffer the indignity and possibly the economic problem of not being entitled to their partner's superannuation benefits in the case of their partner dying. That is an outrage. It should never be forgotten that in this matter this Prime Minister has again played loose with the truth and has sought to divide the community-and unnecessarily so. I believe that the community will not forget that this is a Prime Minister who is more about vilifying significant minority groups than improving health and education in this country and focusing on things that people in my electorate and indeed all electorates in Australia are wanting to see fixed. That is the blight on this government and this Prime Minister. This is another effort by the Prime Minister to dog-whistle, to see the worst side of humanity and to play to people's prejudices. In the end, I do not think it will be acceptable to the Australian community, because this country is about a fair go, tolerating people and tolerating their differences."
13321,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Robert Baldwin,1,LP,Paterson,4," From the outset I want to make it very clear that I am a Christian and that I regularly attend church. I get great comfort from the teachings of Christ and the support of my fellow parishioners. As a Christian I have no prejudices against people who are different from me-for the colour of their skin, for the lifestyle choices they make, or for the religions they may or may not practise. I have an acceptance of every individual as an individual. But as a Christian I have to be true to all of my convictions, and that means when issues like same-sex marriages arise I will speak out for what I and the broad majority of Australians believe in.  The changes proposed will entrench in federal laws that a marriage is between a man and a woman. It is important to understand that these amendments do not seek to remove any rights that homosexuals currently have with regard to marriage laws, as same-sex marriages are not currently recognised. There is no doubt that this topic is by its very nature an emotive topic. When we seek to entrench into law who can marry, there will be some people who will be offended that they do not fall within the law. I received one letter from a woman in a relationship with another woman. She asked if I questioned whether or not she loves her partner. I do not question her love for her partner, nor do I question the time they have spent together. I do not sit in judgment of their partnership or their relationship, but what I am seeking to do is ensure that the Christian values of marriage-being an institution between a man and woman for the purpose of procreation-remain as the cornerstone of the foundation of our society. This lady's was but one letter compared to the many I have received from my own constituents and those in neighbouring electorates in support of the amendments to the legislation. I have also had discussions with individuals who are homosexual and who have also stated a support for this bill. They have stated to me that they do not want the Marriage Act changed to allow for same-sex marriages; they accept their current arrangements. There is an old saying in politics: you can't please all of the people all of the time; you can please some of the people most of the time and most of the people some of the time. This is one of those times when some people will not be pleased but most will be. The feedback I have received from my constituents, from those who attend church regularly and those who consider themselves Christian but do not attend church-in fact, from others who do not profess any religious beliefs-is that they overwhelmingly support these changes to ensure that the law specifically states that a marriage is a union between man and woman. Paul, at verse 26 of the first chapter of his Epistle to the Romans, writes: The time that Paul speaks of is in the years immediately following the death of Christ-the time when Christianity was a secret movement kept alive by true believers in God and the sermons of Jesus. This is the time that the Romans sought to remove Christianity from the world because it challenged the social mores of the Roman Empire. Paul's writings in particular went against the entire Roman social culture-the avarice, the lust, the carnage, the incest. The teachings of Christ taught a new way of living that would force radical change on the Roman Empire. Christianity did not just force change on the powerful leaders but on all of the people. In allowing same-sex marriages, we jeopardise the core of Christianity, we devalue the sacrifice made by Christ and his disciples and we devalue the very foundations of the Christian faith. Some will argue that true love between two men or two women is just as valid as that between a man and a woman, but in the terms of the Christian faith-that faith which created marriage as we know it today-marriage is not recognised when it is between two men or two women. It was not considered right by Paul in his Epistle to the Romans, and today the same is true.  Bit by bit, the church and its teachings are being whittled away by those who do not attend church or practise religion. The perfect example of this is that more people identify Christmas with a Coca-Cola symbol of Santa Claus than they do with a nativity scene. In much the same way, marriage is becoming a symbol of a union between two people-not an institution where lives are built together and children are brought into the world and raised and loved. Christianity is only alive today because of the teachings of Paul and those enlightened men and women who continued Christ's teachings throughout the years of persecution by the Romans. Paul's teachings represented a minority in his time. He went against what was considered socially acceptable and he taught a different way of thinking. The fact that he knew that Christ himself was crucified and that continuing Christ's teachings would mean sure death gives his words more resonance. And perhaps it gives us greater reason to protect his teachings-that people should be encouraged to enter into unions between men and women; that the natural way is between a man and a woman. Some argue that the Bible stands in contrast to what is socially accepted today. But it stands as a benchmark of what many people in society believe. In both Genesis 1:28 and Mark 10:6 it is stated that God created humankind in two sexes for the purpose of procreation. God's established law is the basis for marriage. And I can tell you, a lot of people are getting a bit fed up with the boundaries constantly being challenged. Play School should be about Jemima and Big Ted and not include social political messages about what is right or wrong in matters of gender. Television at 7 p.m. should not have to be bleeped over time after time to ensure the timeslot is not compromised by the foul language, discussions of masturbation and boasts of sexual relationships of 12 fake housemates doing nothing. Everyday, the boundaries are being tested. We let one small thing go, then another and then another, and finally Nero is standing on the roof playing his fiddle while the society and city burn. Many people who argue for allowing marriage between a man and a man or a woman and a woman argue that there is no place for Christianity in the debate about homosexuality and marriage laws. I have already discussed how vital Christianity was to preserving the institution of marriage in the form that it takes today. The teachings of Christ and his disciples are the only reason we are standing here today discussing marriage between two men or two women. In the first place, if you take Christianity or God out of this marriage debate, you might as well take marriage out of the debate. Without Christianity, there would be no marriage. The definition of the act of marriage is: the unity of a man and woman under God. The vows of marriage do not talk solely about this mortal life; they talk about eternity. Without God, marriage becomes a piece of paper-easily torn. And maybe this is the reason why 30 percent of marriages fail: people forget that the vows are taken not just between a man and woman to spend the rest of their lives together but also in front of God. Taking vows in front of God-in front of witnesses who similarly believe in God-holds a couple to account. It makes the promises more solemn and gives them a greater reason to keep them. By the same token, if you take God and the teachings of Christ and Paul out of this equation, then you take away the moral arguments against homosexuality. Even Queen Victoria tolerated homosexuality provided it `didn't frighten the horses'. But we are talking about marriage. If you talk about removing God and Christianity from the debate about marriage you may as well not talk about marriage at all. It is moot. The democracy we enjoy today is built on Christianity. The Greeks may have had the most perfect form of democracy around 5,000 years ago, but our democracy was exported from England and it started with the Magna Carta in 1215, which begins: The very document that lays out our democracy, a copy of which sits out near the cloakroom on level 1 in Parliament House, clearly talks about God and the holy church and that the rights of man were to be set out in front of God. Even when King Henry VIII took the holy church out of the equation, he replaced it with the Church of England. In the preamble to the Australian Constitution of 1901 it reads: At the very foundation of our laws there is God, and it should be like this because we are a Christian liberal democracy. In 90 percent of our law making, God and Christianity do not come into the decision-making process; after all, God does not have much to do with road funding-except when it comes to me praying for the funding of the Bucketts Way or Weakley's Drive. But there are times when we have to fall back on our faith to make decisions which will create laws which set the moral and cultural tone of this country. As much as some want to say that God and Christianity have no place in our law making, they do. We do not sacrifice animals and read their entrails to tell the future, because we are Christians. We do not stone a female adulterer to death, because we are Christians. We do not allow people to have more than one wife, because we are Christians. And, in this instance, we are preserving the institution of marriage as being a union between a man and a woman, because we are Christians. There will be some in the community who will condemn me for being a God botherer, but I have to be true to my faith and beliefs. I am here today to not only serve the people of Paterson in the parliament but also serve God. By supporting this bill today I believe I do both."
13322,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Dr Carmen Lawrence,0,ALP,Fremantle,1," However, that was not the principal point that I was going to make in this debate, we need to look at marriage as an evolving institution-because it is. It is not an institution that, as some people have described it, has been the same for thousands and thousands of years; it simply has not. There have been different forms of marriage across cultures and across time. And marriage, if you look at the history of it, did not evolve initially as a solely Christian institution. It exists in many cultures and has taken forms that really had more to do with the disposition of property and inheritance than with the specific blessing of a relationship by some religious organisation.  So let us look at the nature of marriage if we are going to talk about defining it in legislation. Let us look at how it has evolved over time and some of the more curious practices that until recently were embraced by some of our predecessors. For instance, there are examples in Christianity of polygamy-I do not think there has been any polyandry, but there have certainly been polygamous arrangements-continuing to this day in certain parts of the United States, although I know there are attempts being made to reduce the frequency of such arrangements. They have existed even within the Christian tradition and they certainly exist in other cultures and have over time. I do not think any of us would necessarily want to suggest that Australians open up those possibilities; I simply make those observations to suggest that the notion of marriage as an unchanging institution with a single definition is incorrect. Indeed, if you go back through the history of marriage as an institution you will find-I think this is correct; I have not been able to fully check it, but the research seems adequate-that between the fifth and the 14th centuries, for instance, the Roman Catholic Church conducted special ceremonies to bless same-sex unions which were almost identical to those they used to bless heterosexual unions at the time. At the very least these were spiritual if not sexual unions-it is not altogether clear-but there existed a form of ritual even within the Catholic Church. I think it is worth noting that for a long time there were explicit prohibitions too about who could marry which we would no longer consider acceptable. In the 11th century, for instance, Pope Alexander issued a decree prohibiting marriages between couples who were more closely related than sixth cousins. So there were explicit prohibitions against what we would not regard as close relations getting married. As we know from Thomas Hardy's wonderful book, from the 1690s to the 1870s wife sale was common in rural and small town England. Wives were so regarded as property that a husband could actually sell his wife. All he had to do to divorce her before the sale was to present her at an appropriate gathering with a rope around her neck, and offer her in public for sale to another man. So these are some of the precursors, if you like, to the institution of marriage. For a long time, of course, marriage was a strictly civil institution in some places, and religion was not involved at all. In Australia that is still the case. For many people marriage is an entirely secular arrangement. There is no religious ceremony, nor is there required to be. I think it is also worth remembering that for a very long time there were certain groups of people apart from cousins who could not marry in certain parts of the world. Until recently, in South Africa an interracial marriage was considered illegal, as it was in the United States of America. In 1662 in Virginia there was a fine for fornication between interracial people, and marriage between African-Americans and other Americans was all but outlawed in most of the southern United States. Under English common law and all the laws derived from it, married women had very few rights to property and little capacity for entering into agreements or arrangements, which they now can do. I make those points simply to illustrate that this notion that marriage is an entirely religious institution with a simple definition which everybody understands is not the case. We have seen arranged marriages supplanted over time by marriages based on affection and sentiment rather than the economic concerns of the parties involved. For a long time too, many marriages required the consent of parents, something that for the most part is no longer required. In some countries today marriages are still formed between very young people, people we would regard as children. I think it is also worth pointing out that that was the case in our own tradition until reasonably recently, and very young people often entered into what were effectively prearranged marriages-which required the consent of parents, it has to be said, but which we would regard almost as equivalent to child abuse. In all the cultures around the world, including in the West, marriage evolved as a practical device to form alliances between families. It was really about considerations of property, sometimes of religion, and of complementary abilities. These were essentially arrangements of convenience. Although respectful love was supposed to develop in those circumstances, neither sexual nor romantic love was initially the basis for marriage. Indeed, some would argue that, to the extent that that has become the basis for marriage, marriage has become a less stable institution. I do not necessarily endorse that view, but you will hear it argued. Fathers had legal rights in the past to give or withhold consent and, as I say, often entered into economic negotiations about these arrangements. Even in the Western tradition, the bride usually brought some form of dowry and the groom was expected to provide land, tools and the like to support her and the children. Marriage in English law, generally speaking, subsumed the legal being of the wife into that of the husband. So the idea of marriage being between equal partners is a very recent innovation. Married women until my lifetime were often discriminated against explicitly, even in employment in this country and in their capacity to enter into independent financial arrangements, to take out loans and the like. In the sixties, it was still commonplace in most state departments of education to require women to resign when they got married-to give up their permanency. Many of them then became permanently temporary, with effects on their superannuation that are still flowing through today. The university I went to in the sixties and seventies actually required women who wanted to marry to get the permission of their head of department if they wanted to remain permanent. So the idea of a woman as an equal partner in marriage is a very recent idea in law and in practice in our own community. By the mid-19th century, sentimental doctrines of romantic love came to prevail but Victorian marriages, like those I have just referred to, still demanded strict fulfilment of gender specific roles centred around family responsibilities. I know that there are some people who still have that idea of marriage and that in some people's views the woman's role is clearly defined in religious doctrine and any departure from it is to be frowned upon. Indeed, I sometimes think that is the Prime Minister's view of the relationships between men and women in marriage in this country. But the sexual revolution in the second part of the last century changed all of that and weakened the connection between sex and marriage. I am often surprised to hear people talk about marriage as though its sole purpose today is for the procreation and support of children, when we all know that there are many satisfactory marriages-marriages undertaken in good faith-where there are no children, either by choice or because that is the way matters have evolved.  So I want to point out that, in the context of debating the definition of marriage, we should be very careful. That is why our predecessors did not put it in the legislation-so as not to pre-empt arrangements that people may enter into and not to deny people certain rights, privileges and understandings that would apply if we allowed the institution to evolve through the common law. The argument that we hear from the conservative side, and we heard it from the previous speaker, is that marriage has endured for thousands of years-it has, but not in the form that we would recognise-and that it is a bedrock institution and should not be changed. I hope I have demonstrated at least in part that that is not the case. The reality is that between cultures and over time the meaning and form of marriage have changed dramatically, as I have described. I think you will find that Australians understand that, because Australians enter into a great variety of relationships of longstanding commitment. Sometimes they are marriages conducted under the auspices of particular churches or religious traditions complete, in the case of a Catholic service with a mass, or an Anglican communion service or an appropriate Jewish religious ceremony. But many Australians go through secular marriages conducted in their own backyard or homes with family present, and they make a vow and commitment to one another, hoping it will be a union that lasts for a lifetime but knowing realistically that the divorce figures belie that fact-that many Australians, both those who have been through the religious ceremony and those who have been through the secular ceremony, end up separating at some point, going about their lives and needing arrangements through our divorce courts. So, in reality, marriage is not for life, and many people understand that well or have certainly come to believe it, even if they are hopeful at the point of being married. Australians attitudes are also much more flexible. They do not necessarily see marriage as an institution that they need to enter into in order to show commitment to one another or to have children. There are a great many people who live in stable, longstanding relationships without ever entering into marriage. Many of those people have been discriminated against in law, and it is a matter of record that Labor governments around the country are trying to ensure that de facto couples get the same rights and entitlements as those who enter into marriage as described in this legislation. Then there are the people for whom marriage is now to be denied, and I understand that the common law for the moment effectively precludes marriage between homosexual couples. However, Australians are not so certain that that is necessarily a good thing. The most comprehensive survey of social attitudes on this question found that 65 percent of people under 35 years of age in Australia would happily describe same-sex couples with children as a family-and 56 percent of people between 35 and 45 years of age have the same attitude. These Australians recognise that a same-sex couple with children is a family. They do not have any trouble with that at all. I am not sure about the older group. I imagine they would be more conservative on this question, but I think we need to put our debate in the context of what the citizens of this country regard as reasonable. When it comes to the specific provisions of this bill, my concern is that we are sending a message to gay and lesbian couples in this community-couples who have longstanding relationships-that theirs are effectively second-rate relationships, that they are to be seen as unworthy in some respect and not to be accorded the respect that this parliament gives to people who are in a married relationship. I have to say that, no matter how you look at the proposals that this legislation embodies, they have a nasty political whiff about them, because the Howard government has shown itself capable on many occasions of pulling out an issue that it regards as likely to divide the community and to result in the expression of certain prejudices for its own political advantage. You have to ask: why are we debating this right now? This government has been in office since 1996. It has had many opportunities to open up this question to the wider community. There has not been a debate in Australia about gay marriages. There has been a debate in the United States about gay marriages and, as in other things, this Prime Minister finds it attractive to follow along behind the American conservatives. I think that is very unseemly. It is not fair to the Australian community, because when you are making changes of the kind described in this legislation you really do need a mandate, the community does need an opportunity to discuss it and you need to think about the protection of minority rights and interests and how best to do that. We should debate what marriage should mean in a secular society, respecting people's religious beliefs and the equality that should apply to being a citizen in this country. We are effectively enshrining in legislation a form of discrimination which most of us would want to see eliminated in other forms of-  Ultimately that may be what the Australian people decide. It may be that, after proper debate about the pros and cons of these arrangements, they would accede to what is existing common law. But to close the door in the way that this government is proposing as a political strategy I think does raise questions about its good faith. Frankly, I have no difficulty at all in seeing this as just another form of `divide and conquer'. You sow seeds of bias, prejudice and discrimination out in the community, just scatter them around a bit, and then allow them to grow for your political benefit. It is a very nasty tactic. I have seen this government do it with Indigenous people. It has tried it before with lesbian couples in relation to the IVF debate. It has done it with asylum seekers. In my view, history will judge this Prime Minister very harshly for having implemented this strategy so comprehensively and so often in Australian political life since 1996.  It is always easy to find people or groups in the community that you do not like or that you know others do not like and to engage them politically on the basis of their dislike for that particular group. This is not about protecting the institution of marriage. As I understand it, there is no suggestion in the law that it is under challenge. There are no cases, as far as I know, specifically challenging this matter, although there may be some in prospect. If this legislation passes, people who have entered into marriages in other countries-gay and lesbian couples-will find they are not recognised here; and they are to be prevented from undertaking adoptions as well.  As I say, these things need to be fully debated: what is in the interests of a child; what are the best circumstances for children from other countries to come into our country to begin their lives anew, many of them from very tragic circumstances? The message to the gay and lesbian community is a very cruel one. It basically says that members of the government regard their relationships as second rate and that they regard them as inappropriate partners for one another. We all know that sexual preference is something that most of the rest of the world regards as a basis for discrimination that should not exist and there are all sorts of legislation and international agreements to prevent it. So they are being told, `You are not worthy of entering into longterm relationships. The fact that you want to marry is not seen as a vote of confidence in marriage but as some form of perversion. And your desire to bring up children in families'-families that many Australians recognise as reasonable-`is one that we repudiate.' That is what this parliament would effectively be saying to members of the gay and lesbian community. That in my view is discrimination front and centre and it is a very cruel way of treating a minority group in our community. It is an easy thing to find these minority groups and beat them up. It is not politically very smart but can be very effective. But I am pleased to say on this occasion that the Australian community has reacted to the government's strategy of using gay and lesbian people as a political weapon while caring not one bit about their feelings. Like many, I have had a large number of emails from both constituents and people around Australia expressing their hurt feelings, as much as anything-people saying, `I am writing to you about the proposed ban on gay marriage and overseas adoption. I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed and shocked I am.' Other people talk about the pain that they have suffered having children in communities and now being faced with discrimination against them in a way they thought they had overcome-their children at school effectively having to live with the idea that Mr Howard and the government are opposed to their parents. "
13323,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Patrick Farmer,1,LP,Macarthur,2," I rise today to speak in support of the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 as it has been put forward by the Prime Minister and the coalition government. As a representative of Western Sydney, an area with strong beliefs in the traditional institution of marriage between a man and a woman, I am concerned with the possible erosion of the sacred institution of marriage. The legislation honours marriage between one man and one woman. Up until now, neither the Marriage Act 1961 nor the Constitution contained a clear definition of marriage. The Family Law Act 1975 prevents regulation being made either under the Hague convention or under bilateral agreements to facilitate same-sex couples adopting a child from overseas. The provisions of this bill are to define marriage as a union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, to confirm that unions solemnised overseas between same-sex couples will not be recognised in Australia, and to prevent intercountry adoptions by same-sex couples. I uphold the government's view that marriage be legally defined as such, with the intention of maintaining the Christian as well as the traditional concept of marriage. By legally recognising the unique relationship of a man and a woman in marriage, we continue to instil the special status of this most fundamental institution in our society. This legislation gives us a rare opportunity to question and to re-examine some of our community's bedrock institutions, such as marriage. The matrimonial institution, worthy of protection, has endured for thousands of years. The union between men and women through marriage, tested over centuries across the world, has become a universal institution. It is a social institution that has formed the very basis of the whole fabric of our modern society and it has always been understood to involve the union of a man and a woman. Whilst I recognise that there are many different relationships in our society, I also believe that they cannot be given equal status to a marriage between two members of the opposite sex. This bill does not discriminate against any kind of relationship; it simply reinforces the definition of marriage being between a man and a woman as the founding institution of our society. The act of marriage is something very profound and goes much deeper than merely an expression of affection between two people. There is no denying that the expressions of emotion, support and public commitment have been recognised as among the attributes of marriage. Such interests alone do not confer a right to marriage, however. Marriage is not meant to serve a single purpose of individual interests; it is about serving others-our children and our family. Some may argue that heterosexual intercourse, procreation and family responsibilities are not necessarily inseparable and that there are alternatives. After all, we do live in the 21st century-an era of significant technological and social change, where sexual alternatives are readily accepted by many people in our society. But I ask you here today: why should we do things differently just because we can? Why should we drift away from the basics of our human values and traditions? Simply because we live in a society with advanced technology, where anything is possible and different ways of life are available, is not reason enough to change the sanctity of marriage from the way that it was meant to be. I believe that this is the very time that we should stand up and confirm the sanctity of marriage. I am not saying that two men cannot raise a child or that two women cannot raise a child. What I am saying is that marriage is not just about sex or expressing individuality. Marriage should not be used as a policy tool to be redefined to achieve social goals and should not be defined or legislated by courts and judiciary. It is simply about love and the commitment between a husband and a wife to spend the rest of their lives together, often with the intention to bring a child into this world and to raise a family.  I believe that I represent the 80,000 residents in Macarthur and the majority of the Australian community when I say that the institution of marriage does play a most vital role in procreation, the creation of a stable family structure and stable communities. Surely this must be the reason why the majority continue to choose the traditional family arrangement, believing this best meets the needs of families and the Australian society. Perhaps most importantly we have to teach our children about love and sexuality from a female and a male point of view and give them an equal opportunity to make their preferred choice of lifestyle. It is our responsibility as parents to ensure that the needs of our children are met. Our children, including adopted children, should be given the opportunity to be raised by a mother and a father. The marital family unit is the foremost environment for the education and socialisation of children. Children learn about their world, and their place in this world, primarily through their parents. A family defined by two parents of opposite gender continues to be the most prevalent social structure in which the majority of children are born, nurtured and raised to perform their role in our society. This is important not only for a society and our families but also for our lives. By supporting this legislation we are encouraging parents to remain committed to each other and to provide their children with an unbiased education about both men and women. This institution of marriage between a man and a woman does exactly this. Even more so, it facilitates a stabilising future and social structure for our children, and marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of our species. This government seeks to establish its foundation on the basis of the idea of family consisting of one man and one woman. This stable and noble foundation is the basis of all decision making in our social and political development. It is also true that historical changes in our cultural, political and economic conditions have altered some of our traditional notions about marriage as an institution. Nevertheless, the institution of marriage remains the principal basis of our social foundation. We need to promote this view of marriage for what it truly is-a pillar of our society-and it should not be altered. I am confident that the majority of Australians would agree that the amendments to the Marriage Act 1961 and the Family Law Act 1975 are extremely important and legitimate in ensuring the promotion and support of a most favourable social structure in which to bear and to raise children. The Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill, when enacted, will ensure that marriage status continues to serve its purpose in our society. This is the point that I want to leave with all of you: we need to get back to the fundamentals. Marriage should be between one man and one woman, and the reason God created both man and woman is to procreate. By this we ensure that our values, our traditions and our heritage will live on through our children."
13324,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Roger Price,1,ALP,Chifley,2," The honourable member for Macarthur talked about the sanctity of marriage. Let me say that I do not think that this House, or even the Senate-or the two houses together-can confer any sanctity on anything. When I got married it was not the civilian bit of paper that conferred sanctity upon the union; it was the receipt of the sacrament of marriage. That is what was important to me. For those who see the sanctity of marriage as being important, it is not what happens in this House, in the Senate or in the parliament but what happens in the church, in the mosque, in the temple, in the synagogue that confers sanctity. It is not the business of the state to interfere in what goes on there. I might say, though, that my electorate's namesake, Ben Chifley, was not able to receive that sanctity, because of prejudices that operated during the day. Other speakers have commented that the Prime Minister, in announcing this legislation, indicated that he was going to rectify something that has been an outstanding injustice for a long time, and that is the inability of same-sex couples to legally access superannuation. Not that the census is the best way of identifying people who are in same-sex de facto arrangements- I also need to stand up and say how very much I regret a past action. When I was involved in looking at child support in the mid-1990s, child support in relation to same-sex couples was clearly an issue. Given the controversy of the report and the matters that we were dealing with, I took the view that dealing with same-sex relationships, and particularly with respect to child support, was one bridge too far. Having seen how the report was by and large ignored, I have lived to regret that decision, and I would not make the same decision again. The point I am trying to make is that, whether we like it or not, there are same-sex unions and it is ridiculous for this parliament to ignore them. It is really disappointing that, having promised relief on superannuation, this bill has betrayed the aspirations of those people. We have seen some legislation come into this place that is not really designed for the betterment of Australia and Australians and that has been clearly identified as a wedge for a forthcoming election. The classic example before this was the bill that was rushed in to amend the Sex Discrimination Act so that the Catholic Education Office would be able to provide scholarships for 10 male teachers. What a farce and a fiasco! As I commented then, I have never seen such an outpouring of concern and distress from coalition backbenchers. And where is that bill in the wash of things? It has disappeared into the ether. This bill, as the member for Wentworth opposite knows, makes absolutely no change to the situation of same-sex couples in Australia. Prior to this bill they were not able to be married and after this bill they will not be able to be married. The current situation is based on case law, and we are merely institutionalising that with this change. I will be interested to hear from the member for Wentworth because, whilst all members of parliament have constituents who are in same-sex relationships, he probably has more than most. I will be most interested to hear whether or not the member for Wentworth is concerned about the betrayal on superannuation and whether or not he will argue that this gross injustice in relation to superannuation should be overcome. There is one other issue I want to raise, relating to the contribution from the member for Macarthur about the sanctity of marriage. From memory, something like 45 percent of couples are living in a de facto relationship. They are choosing not to get married. I have a profound belief in the institution of marriage, but I do not think it is right for me as a member of parliament-or even the parliament itself-to impose that belief on others. A huge number of young people today are choosing not to be married, not to have a civilian bit of paper that says that they are a union or living within the sanctity of marriage. I am not sure how this bill is embracing this current phenomenon. If we wish to speculate about the future, I do not believe we can suggest that these numbers are going to diminish and that we are suddenly going to have 98 percent or 99 percent of all Australians living in a marriage. I think the reverse is true. I think this trend of increasing numbers of de facto relationships is going to increase. I understand people have very strong views on this subject. But those strong views emanate from what happens in churches, temples and mosques. This bill does not interfere with what happens in those instances. But I predict that in the future we will have to revisit this legislation, because we cannot ignore realities. The realities are that significant numbers of our fellow Australians are living in long-term, meaningful and-in the words of the member for Macarthur-loving relationships. We cannot afford to turn our backs on the reality of that, pretend that they do not exist or pretend that there are not children of those unions. I have said what I want to say. If Mr Howard was again looking for a king hit in terms of wedge politics, he has missed out with this legislation. It would be far better for the Prime Minister to take forward a program of future action for his fourth term, rather than try to play politics of the lowest common denominator. As Prime Minister of Australia, he should do better."
13325,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Peter King,1,LP,Wentworth,1," A couple of things which might be said to be beneficial come from this bill and the cognate legislation. The first is that the financial arrangements, particularly the definition of interdependence, will change so that those who establish gay relationships will not be discriminated against in Commonwealth fiscal and revenue relationships. That has been the undertaking in relation to the cognate legislation, and I am informed by a member of the government that this legislation will be taken through the Senate with legislation which presently rests there. So I am looking forward to having that ensure that all discrimination against gay couples that are properly established and appropriately defined-in accordance, perhaps, with the definition in the migration regulations-will cease. In regard to this legislation in relation to the definition of marriage, it is interesting to look back to what Senator Gorton, during the carriage of the bill for the 1961 Marriage Act, said about this question. He said: It is important that our churches are very closely involved in the definition of marriage and what is acceptable. I for one agree that in our society marriage is, according to the current law and according to the accepted tenets, the union of a man and a woman in a long and loving relationship. But it may be that this legislation is going to defeat its own purposes. The attempt to exclusively define marriage itself gives rise to the recognition that section 51(xxi) of the Constitution gives rise to a power to exclude certain people from marriage in such a way that another parliament could redefine marriage and include those people. One of the reasons that the wisdom of the parliament of 1961 should prevail is that it may be that future societies will change the definition of marriage. One of the purposes of an evolving society is-in my view, anyway-to ensure the family, which is the bedrock of our society, remains as such. It is possible that the definition of marriage in this legislation is going to give rise to constitutional challenges. We know that Justice McHugh in a recent case in the High Court and Justice Brennan in Fisher and Fisher and in another case, Hyde v. Hyde and Woodmansee, have made observations which suggest that the definition of marriage in the Constitution may in fact have some evolutionary nature. I do not have time to go into those issues at the moment, as interesting as they are. But I will say this: those constitutional and personal matters give rise to the consideration that, in my view, the bill before the House ought to be a matter of conscience. I am disappointed that this legislation is not a vote of conscience, because on a matter as personal as the nature of marriage many different views will be acknowledged and it is only appropriate that such a course be taken. Nonetheless, that is not the case, so one has to deal with the matter as it stands. I have also raised the concern that the exclusive definition of marriage and the way that it has been done may render illegal de facto relationships because of the impact that the public law may have upon the definition in the common law of what an accepted de facto relationship is. I refer to the decision of the Court of Appeal in New South Wales in the matter of Seidler v. Schallhofer, in which Justice Hutley, Justice Hope and Justice Reynolds acknowledged that an agreement to enter into a de facto relationship is not, as a result of evolving law, unlawful. If we start fiddling with the definition of marriage that may have some unfortunate implications for other sorts of established relationships, and that is a matter of some concern. My time has run out, I regret to say, in accordance with today's permitted debating time. I am concerned about the definition exclusively put in this fashion. I have a significant number of established, happy and long-term gay couples in my electorate. I would not wish in any way it be thought that there was anything to be said offensively against the establishment of such families. On the other hand, I also recognise that the institution of marriage as it is is part of our society and is part of that bedrock which I mentioned earlier: namely, the established family."
13326,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Peter Andren,1,IND,Calare,4," The amendment to the Marriage Act 1961 clearly defines what constitutes a marriage for the purposes of the act. A marriage is determined to be the union of a man and woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life. This intention is clear in the act as it stands in section 46(1), which deals with certain statements that must be made by a marriage celebrant. This amendment presents no departure from the act's current function. I support the inclusion of this definition of marriage. The act has served its purpose to date, and this amendment will in no way detract from its function. This amendment to the Marriage Act no more discriminates against certain groups in our society than the intention of the act as it stands already does. I do believe that if there is, as the Attorney-General stated in his second reading speech, `significant community concern about the possible erosion of the institution of marriage' there are better ways to focus our efforts to protect the institution than banning people from joining it. We could start by tackling the causes of marriage breakdowns in this country. I believe that our time in this place would be much better served if we were concentrating on social dysfunction and the breakdown of relationships rather than finding ways to discourage a lifelong bonding between people in whatever context. As far as I can see, if this place were to allow same-sex marriages, the end result would have no effect on the incidence of heterosexual marriages and heterosexual couples willing to contribute to the survival of the species. The amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 effectively ban same-sex couples from adopting children from overseas and prohibit any person from facilitating the adoption of a child from overseas by a same-sex couple. This seems in the most part to be aimed at preventing immigration officers issuing the necessary visas for any children adopted by same-sex couples to enter Australia. This is borne out somewhat by the comment on the adoption issue attributed to the Attorney-General in an article in a recent Canberra Times: that `it was up to the federal government, not the states and territories, to decide who entered the country'. This suggests that the government approaches adoption from an immigration perspective rather than on the ability of a couple or a person to care for and nurture a child. Or perhaps it is more indicative of where the federal government has identified an opening to inject its influence into the area of adoption that is administered by the states and territories.  The government's amendment will prohibit a same-sex couple from an overseas adoption by making it against the law for any entry visa to be issued in these circumstances, even though a specific state or territory may have deemed the couple eligible to adopt. This is not to suggest that there will be a flood of same-sex couples adopting children from overseas. The states and territories apply eligibility criteria equally to domestic and overseas adoptions-and we need to keep in mind that they are hardly uniform in their approach. The Australian Capital Territory, Western Australia and Tasmania adoption laws consider same-sex couples eligible to adopt. This is applied in much the same way to de facto heterosexual couples, usually with certain conditions to ascertain the stability of the relationship and the commitment of the prospective adoptive parents. However, New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory do not allow same-sex couples to adopt children. Their respective adoption acts basically determine that `a couple', whether married or de facto, refers to a relationship between a man and a woman. In fact, the Queensland act also excludes heterosexual de facto couples, although this is under review. So, despite the fact that the majority of states already subscribe to the federal government's approach on same-sex adoptions-and in fact do so to a greater degree, as they ban domestic adoptions by same-sex couples-the government have decided that it is necessary to close the loophole available to these couples in Western Australia, the ACT and Tasmania, and then only half close it, as they cannot ban domestic same-sex adoptions in these states without being accused of infringing states rights. And the government do not want the focus of this debate skewed from same-sex couples to states rights. This policy is full of holes. Even in those states and territories where same-sex couples are banned from adopting, there remains an indirect mechanism for a same-sex couple to adopt, as most allow single persons to adopt-albeit in special circumstances. One partner of a same-sex couple could well take this approach. However rare a successful adoption in these circumstances may be, the opportunity legally remains. This is policy on the run, and the government is scraping the bottom of its wedge politics barrel. If the government were truly committed to the protection of the institutions of marriage and the family from the perceived threat from same-sex couples, surely it should have taken the time to draft federal template legislation for a uniform national approach to adoption, complete with its exclusion of same-sex couples, and bring the states and territories under control and have the full debate that this issue certainly requires instead of attacking it from this piecemeal and political perspective. Instead, we have an inconsistent patchwork policy, with the Commonwealth exerting its leverage on the states and territories through its responsibility for immigration law. The final part of this policy package highlights this inconsistency even further. The government's changes to the tax treatment of inherited superannuation for same-sex couples-bringing them into line with married and de facto couples-are to be moved in the choice of superannuation bill in the other place. This is a thinly veiled attempt to distract attention from the obvious incongruity of banning a same-sex marriage on one hand whilst, on the other hand, recognising that the strength of commitment in such relationships can be equal to that of any married or de facto heterosexual couple. This is a double standard of epic proportions-and I need only look as far as the Treasurer's recent address at the National Day of Thanksgiving at Scots Church in Melbourne to see this. The Treasurer spoke of the `tradition that underlies our society-respect for individuals, tolerance within a framework of law and mutual respect'. He also said, `A government should never get into religious endeavours.' On both counts raised by the Treasurer, the Prime Minister obviously disagrees-judging by this legislation. I support the amendments to the Marriage Act 1961. As I said earlier, I do not feel these amendments change the operation of that act in any way. I support the government's changes to policy on tax treatment of superannuation for same-sex couples. I do not support interfering in states or territories rights, except in the most extreme circumstances-as with the former mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory. The adoption changes are not borne of extreme circumstances, and adoption should remain the domain of the states, where the best interests of children are well protected."
13327,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Paul Neville,1,NATS,Hinkler,3," From time immemorial, marriage has been a framework from which other aspects of orderly society have been regulated. Public health, inheritance, transfer of wealth and, in past times, even the alignment of nations and international treaties have hung on marriage. But the one overriding factor in Western society is that marriage always took place between a man and a woman. There are many aspects to the institution of marriage, the formal union between a man and a woman. It is a framework recognised by society, by law and by the church, and it is the formal expression of love and commitment between two people. But our modern society is apparently moving away from that. Let me make myself clear on this matter: I am not homophobic and I am against all forms of discrimination. People should be able to live their lives in Australian society without prejudice, discrimination or bias. I am not judgmental of single-sex relationships, and I recognise that such people should be able to transfer property, superannuation rights and the like. But minorities cannot redefine marriage. No minority group has the right to attach traditional symbols to their own circumstances and turn the institution into something it is not. Some would argue that to alter the essential nature of the marriage union and its ceremony is to degrade it to the point of meaninglessness. Almost every society and religion sanctifies and consecrates the union between a man and a woman. In most societies, marriage has been a monogamous union between a man and a woman, though not exclusively so. It is seen to be a societal framework, a contract and the best environment in which to raise children. It is seen by some religions-notably, Christianity-to be a sacrament. Even atheistic societies, while not recognising the sacramental purpose of the union, have recognised its higher purpose. In the early days of the Soviet Union, the so-called bourgeois institution of marriage was dispensed with. But, even in that atheistic society, the state came to realise the importance of monogamy for the raising of children and the stability of society.  As society's formal expression of commitment, marriage is only a recent phenomenon. Our modern society is rapidly moving away from traditional structures. Our moral, legal and social expectations have morphed us into an `almost anything goes' society. Of course `normal' society has its taboos but, more and more often, minority groups are pushing the boundaries. Fringe groups seek the benefits attached to mainstream society but do not want to adhere to its strictures. Do not get me wrong-I repeat: I am against all forms of discrimination. But minorities cannot redefine marriage. It is the bedrock of society and should not be moulded to suit the changing mores and expectations of minority groups. On this issue I am completely determined. My electorate office has taken several messages of support for the bill, one of which said: Modern relationships take many different forms. We have de facto relationships, single-parent families, same-sex couples, divorcees, arranged marriages and marriages of convenience. I accept that we cannot shut the gate once the horse has bolted. My point is that people are free to choose their relationships and arrangements, as they always have been, but legal marriage should not exist outside the vows made between a man and a woman. People are free to have long-term relationships and commitment ceremonies if they wish. Indeed, they can take part in wedding ceremonies overseas. But those unions will not be recognised as marriages in Australia. A 2002 research report compiled by 13 American scholars, titled Why marriage matters: twenty-one conclusions from the social sciences, concluded: I agree wholeheartedly with that statement, which is why I support the bill banning same-sex couples from adopting children from overseas countries. The majority of Australians think that children, including adopted children, should have the opportunity, all things being equal, to be raised by a mother and a father. That is a compelling argument and one I agree with. I know that families which fall outside the definition of the traditional nuclear format often raise happy, well- adjusted children. But I stay strong on the point that every child deserves the love and affection of a mum and a dad. Again it may boil down to the heart versus the head, but I have never once heard anyone argue against this point. The 2002 study I referred to previously reached some fundamental conclusions: (1) that marriage increases the likelihood that children will have a good relationship with their father; (2) growing up outside an intact marriage increases the likelihood that children will themselves divorce or become unwed parents; and (3) children who live with their own two married parents enjoy better physical health, on average, than do children in other family forms.  I have always been a proponent of the traditional form of marriage and advocate spouses sticking together through thick and thin. Life and love are not easy. There are good times and bad, as referred to in the traditional wedding service. I do not support same-sex couples adopting children. I believe children are a blessing and it is every parent's duty to care for, love and guide their offspring as they grow. I sometimes hear the argument that other forms of relationships can express these things just as well. I do not think the evidence is there. We can look in years to come from this `anything goes' society and wonder what the effects will be even on things as fundamental as genetics in two or three generations time. I think this is the time for Australian society to draw a line in the sand. It is time to recognise that marriage is essentially the union between a husband and wife. When we bring children into the world, some parents decide to have a christening, some people decide to have a baptism, some people decide to have a naming ceremony. But a christening is not a naming ceremony and a naming ceremony is not a christening or a baptism. I think most people recognise that. When we come to marriage, people are free to enter into living arrangements and are free to have ceremonies of commitment if they wish. They are free to have contracts. I make no judgment about those things. But those relationships are not marriage. I commend the government for having the courage to put this legislation forward and I support it wholeheartedly."
13328,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Tanya Plibersek,0,ALP,Sydney,1," Through the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 the Prime Minister is seeking to amend the Marriage Act to insert the definition that marriage is `between a man and a woman, entered into for life, to the exclusion of all others'. The sad fact is that human beings are frail creatures, and I know very few marriages that meet the criteria of being `to the exclusion of all others' and `for life'. If these are really the criteria the Prime Minister sets for marriage then very few couples measure up. We are all fallible and many marriages fall by the wayside. Many have difficult times-some end, some rebuild. The point is that as a society we are stronger when we look for ways to celebrate and increase the sum total of love: not wall it in, deny it or ignore it because it does not read like a Mills and Boon novel. The changes to the Marriage Act which the Prime Minister is proposing are unnecessary and they are discriminatory. Some time in the not too distant future, people will look back on this desperate attempt at wedge politics and treat it with the contempt it deserves. Some time in the not too distant future, there will be formal recognition of same-sex couples, and the sky will not fall in, and we will not be destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrah, and life will continue. The main difference will be fewer violent or abusive attacks on gay men and lesbians, and fewer teenagers suiciding, because they will not be taught to feel shame about their sexuality as many are now.  These changes are not necessary from a legal viewpoint. One has to wonder, with the packed legislative agenda that the government claims it has, why it would make such legislation a priority. Not one extra man or woman would be able to marry their same-sex partner if this law is not passed. The amendments are unnecessary because, firstly, the Marriage Act already says marriage is between a man and a woman. Secondly, the common law states that a marriage is the `voluntary union for life of one man and one woman' in Hyde v. Hyde, 1866. Thirdly, countries where courts have extended marriage to same-sex couples have entrenched rights of equality absent in Australia. In Canada the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in section 15 specifically provides for the right of equality before the law. There is no similar right of equality under Australian law. Any suggestion that Australian courts may follow the lead of Canadian courts is misinformed and fails to understand the particular legislative background in Canada, which differs substantially from that of Australia in the area of fundamental rights and freedoms. Those European countries where same-sex marriages are permitted, such as Belgium, have chosen after much community debate to legislate to allow such unions, usually because their de facto relationship recognition is so poor. Fourthly, the proposed definition anticipates that marriage is a continuing union `for life' notwithstanding the ability of parties to a marriage in Australia to divorce under the Family Law Act. The words `for life' are consequently inappropriate given that there is no suggestion that the amendments are intended to abolish divorce. This just shows how ill thought out and rushed this legislation is. Since when do we make legislation to reassert the status quo? Since it has become a possible political wedge. This government and this Prime Minister should be ashamed that, with all of the pressing issues facing Australia today-our involvement in the so-called war on terror and what it means for our place in the world and our safety, the destruction of Medicare, the affordability of education and hundreds more I could name-they are wasting the time of the parliament reasserting the status quo for political purposes. Does anyone believe that it is a coincidence that this legislation came up at the same time as the member for Makin was making the front page of every newspaper with new revelations about the trip to Paris she took with her then boyfriend? This is an ugly little trick designed to rebuild the government's family values credentials after that fiasco. This legislation is also offensive. It is offensive because it goes out of its way to say that same-sex love is second-class love. As one of my constituents wrote to the government: Not all gay men and lesbians, even those in committed relationships, wish to marry. They just really resent being told that they have no right to want the same options as their straight brothers and sisters. I will be moving an amendment to this legislation in the consideration in detail stage which will state explicitly that same-sex de facto relationships should have exactly the same legal status, rights and responsibilities as heterosexual de facto relationships.  The adoption provision that the government has introduced is also offensive because it says that gay men and lesbians cannot be trusted around children. The coded message is that homosexuality is the same as paedophilia. It suggests that children are better off growing up in an orphanage in a developing country than in a loving family in Australia if that family happens to have two mothers or two fathers. The message that this sends to gay and lesbian parents in Australia is deeply wounding, but the message it sends to their children is even worse. I know a number of children who have grown up with two mothers or two fathers-usually two mothers-and they are perfectly well-adjusted little human beings who understand that their families are different from the norm but who are just fine with that. What right does this Prime Minister have to tell those children that their families are so abnormal and so dangerous that this government has to override state legislation to make sure no more families like theirs are created? What message does this send to those children? There is no evidence that growing up with same-sex parents is in any way harmful to children. A number of my constituents wrote to me saying:  We have no evidence to suggest that growing up with same-sex parents is in any way harmful to children. We do in contrast have evidence that child abuse and neglect are harmful, yet the government is not interested in developing a national plan for child abuse or neglect. We know that pneumococcal disease kills children, yet this government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to follow expert recommendations to vaccinate children against pneumococcal disease. We know that smoking around children harms their health, is associated with low birth weight, with sudden infant death syndrome, with other illnesses and with a greater likelihood the child will become a smoker later in life. This is something we know damages children, but the government has made little or no effort to stop this killer of children. We have the highest rates of child obesity in our history, but the government refuses to join Labor in supporting a ban on the advertising of junk food during children's television viewing hours. It seems absolutely bizarre to me that instead of doing anything to deal with these great challenges facing children, not to mention the chronic federal underfunding of the public education system, this government instead builds up this straw man, this imaginary threat, just to be seen to tackle it with this unnecessary and offensive legislation. It seems bizarre also that parliamentarians, people who choose to spend well over 80 nights a year away from their children, have the right to suggest that loving same-sex parents cannot bring up a child. I have heard several times in this debate that children would ideally have a mother and a father who were married and so on. I am very sorry to disabuse the pollyannas who have suddenly populated this place-there are no ideal families. All families face challenges and most muddle through as best they can. That is just life. There are no ideal parents and there are no ideal families. All we can do is our best. If our children scramble into adulthood mostly undamaged, with intact self-esteem, a positive outlook and a strong set of values, then we have done a great job as parents. To be honest about same-sex parents, I have to say that the same-sex parents I know are often more thoughtful, dedicated parents than the average parent. They have made a clearer, more considered decision to have a child-there are no unwanted pregnancies in lesbian relationships. Friends of mine, Penny and Jo, who are soon to have their second child, were foster parents for many years before they made a decision to have their own biological children. There is a chronic shortage of foster carers around the country, and one of the reasons is that sometimes the young people are so damaged by their past experiences that they are difficult and disruptive. This couple usually took in teenagers who had experienced years of abuse or neglect before they reached Penny's and Jo's home. This couple and their friend Allan, who shared the caring duties and provided an excellent male role model for these kids, were robbed. They had one girl whose friends trashed their home. They stayed the distance with these troubled kids because they were committed to giving them a better start in life. Who has the right to say that these women, who exhibited so much care and compassion for troubled children who came to them as strangers, have no right to children of their own? I know another family that was made uncomfortably famous by this government's ridiculous response to their appearance on Play School recently. Young Brenna wrote two books with her mum Vicky so that the kids at her school and at other schools would understand that families come in all different shapes and sizes. On top of her usual work and being a mum, Vicky has spent unpaid hour upon hour trying to get these excellent books into schools so that all kids are presented with the notion that families are varied. How many parents go to such lengths to make sure their children feel secure? How can anyone say that Vicky and Jacky are less worthy of being parents than I am? I simply cannot believe that, of all of the things this government could do to improve the lives of Australian children, it thinks the most pressing-the most necessary-is to stop a few couples from two states being able to adopt children from the few countries which might allow adoption to same-sex couples one day. It is a travesty and an insult to every same-sex parent and it is a terrible, terrible message to send their children. I want to end by telling the stories of two couples I know. Colin and Izzy have been together for more than 20 years. Recently they participated in a commitment ceremony in Melbourne, which they wish was a proper marriage with the full force of Australian law. But their relationship is living proof of the fact that people do not need a bit of paper to show their commitment to one another. In 20 years together, Izzy's diabetes has worsened. Colin has saved Izzy's life on a number of occasions by preventing him from slipping into a coma. He has supported Izzy financially when he could not work because of his illness. They have a respectful, committed, loving relationship. Their families and friends see them as an inseparable couple. What is so very threatening about their love that they should be singled out by this absurd legislation and legislatively corralled so that they do not pollute the rest of society? My friends Bruce and Greg had a commitment ceremony many years ago. About seven years ago we celebrated their 10th anniversary with a big party. What was really special about that party was that Bruce's parents and Greg's mum, who had not been at the original ceremony, came to the 10th anniversary party. Over a decade they had come to accept that their sons' love was deep and genuine and deserved celebration. Bruce's brother-in-law's mother-a wonderful, devout Catholic mother of five-said at that ceremony that, seeing all the love that was around her, she could not understand why she had been taught to be prejudiced.  Bruce's mum once said to me that her only regret for her son and his partner was they could not have a family of their own, especially as children loved Greg so much. As it happened, Greg later became the biological father of the daughter of lesbian parents. Bruce and Greg play a big part in this little girl's life, as do their families. How can it be bad for her to have so many extra people to love her? This is the reality of modern life: love comes in all shades and textures. As a society we should recognise and value human kindness and constancy; we should seek to increase the sum total of happiness, not shrink it with proscription and prejudice. Surely, like Bruce's and Greg's parents, as we grow, we will learn to accept what we previously feared."
13329,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Anthony Smith,1,LP,Casey,4," Of course, as he indicated, the reasons for that lack of a specific definition relate mainly to the fact that some 43 years ago, when the Marriage Act was enacted, the need for such a specific black-and-white definition would, I am sure we would all agree, have seemed largely unnecessary to those framing the legislation and to the members of parliament who passed it during that period. However, the intention of the Marriage Act 1961 was clear, as the Attorney pointed out-that is, that marriage is between a man and a woman. That is the intention of the act. That has always been the strong understanding of the act in the Australian community. No-one has doubted that. No-one in Australia, I think, doubts that situation today-no-one doubts that, when the Marriage Act 1961 was framed and the legislation was drawn, that was indeed the unambiguous intention of those framing the legislation. I make that point because even those opposite would not challenge that fact, despite their difference with this side of the parliament, as we have heard from the member for Sydney. Even those opposite would not challenge the fact that the Marriage Act 1961 had a clear intention based on the public understanding that marriage is between a man and a woman. As the Attorney outlined, much of the act indirectly confirms this, but the specific legal definition is not there and that is precisely why we seek through this amending legislation to introduce a formalised definition into the act so that the issue is beyond any doubt whatsoever. And the reason we seek to do that is quite simple: while the current legislation remains as it is, it is potentially open to challenge from those seeking to have same-sex marriages recognised under the Marriage Act. Previous speakers from the other side have made the bizarre claim this morning that this amending legislation is both unnecessary and divisive. They say it is unnecessary because it simply affirms the current law, but it is divisive because it does so. How something which affirms and puts beyond doubt the universal understanding of the current law, which has been on the national statute books for 43 years, can be divisive is really beyond me. What it says about those opposite is that, if they find the amendment that affirms and confirms the current statute divisive, they must think the current law itself is divisive-they must think the Marriage Act is divisive. There can be no other option. If they honestly think an amendment to confirm an existing statute is divisive, they must think that statute itself is divisive. As I indicated, those opposite also think that this amendment is unnecessary because, whilst the Marriage Act 1961 lacks that specific definition of marriage, common law and court-made law make clear what the current statute does not. How a member of this House-in fact, how a member of any house in a democratically elected parliament-can stand in a prime law-making chamber such as this and say that it is unnecessary for a law to be updated, it is unnecessary for a loophole to be closed or it is unnecessary for the parliament to act, because common law or court-made law has it covered, is very illustrative. What it illustrates is what we have seen throughout this debate over the last 24 hours-that is, there is a difference between the approach from our side of the House and the approach from those opposite. We believe parliaments elected by the people should make these decisions primarily, not judges and courts elected by no-one. We have seen judicial activism in other democracies such as the US, and previous speakers, including the member for Aston, articulated that very clearly. We believe it is the role of our parliament to clarify the issue. We do not believe it is the role of the national parliament to acknowledge that there is a gap or a flaw in the existing legislation and then to sit and wonder what a court might do in the future, when we know the legislation itself requires amendment. We on this side of the House believe it is our role to ensure our laws reflect the intention with which they were passed. It is right and proper in this House and in the other place in this parliament that we exercise our duty, our responsibility and our democratic mandate to remove that doubt and to confirm the intention of this parliament-and confirm the will of the Australian people. The public expect nothing less of us. Not only do they expect us to make laws that do the best for Australia but they also rightly expect that, where a deficiency arises, where a loophole appears or where there is a problem with an existing law, we act to fix it-that we do not do what some opposite seem to prefer, which is to ignore it or to wait until a problem arises elsewhere or the legislation itself is subject to challenge or called into question, and then for us to scramble around and try to come in after the event and overturn a court decision. The public expect us to act exactly as we are acting today through this piece of legislation. To those who say it is unnecessary, I say there is never a problem with a parliament confirming their intention; that is precisely our role. And, when it comes to this important issue of marriage, that is exactly what we are doing. This bill reconfirms the definition of marriage, but in doing so it also affirms the fundamental importance of marriage in our society. We seek not just to defend that institution but also to promote it. Of course, no-one is suggesting that there are not meaningful relationships outside marriage, but the point is they do not constitute marriage. Marriage is between a man and a woman. It is the bedrock of our society, it is a fundamental reason for the success of our society and it will be a fundamental ingredient to the future success of our country and the wider society in the years ahead. In passing this amending bill, the parliament is doing precisely what it should be doing.  In closing, I want to refer briefly to the fact that, at the same time the Attorney announced these changes to the Marriage Act, the government also announced it was amending the tax treatment of superannuation to introduce a new concept of financial interdependency, whereby the definition of a `dependant' for the purposes of paying superannuation death benefits will now include a person in an interdependent relationship. For many in the community, including but not only those in same-sex relationships, this amendment removes what they saw as a very practical barrier, where superannuation assets were treated less generously for those who were not married or in a recognised de facto relationship. Now the situation will be identical. The reason I raise that is that on that very practical, sensible level the tax laws are being amended to equalise treatment for all those in financially interdependent relationships. Contrary to the views of those opposite, the vast majority of Australians will not see this legislation as divisive or confrontational; they will rightfully see it as something the parliament should be doing, and I think they will rightfully see it as legislation that should be clarified and probably should have been clarified some time ago."
13330,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Michael Organ,1,AG,Cunningham,3," The government has stated that this bill is necessary because of significant community concern about the possible erosion of the institution of marriage. But where is the evidence for that? It is obvious that there is homophobia out there in the community, but to say that gay marriage will erode the institution of marriage is rubbish. This is not the reason for this bill at all. The reality is otherwise. The government has admitted during this debate that the bill aims to head off court challenges in regard to the recognition of overseas marriages. We only have to look back to the Prime Minister's comments of August last year that gay marriages `do nothing to support the survival of the species' to realise where the government is coming from. As I said, the Greens are fundamentally opposed to the position taken by the Prime Minister and the government on these matters. The Greens have developed detailed policy positions on the many issues facing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people in Australia. I suggest that members of the House visit our web site and read those policies. There are many issues in there, and it would be very informative. These policies were developed over many years in close consultation with the community. The issue of marriage is just one of the many elements of discrimination these people face on a daily basis in this country. The Greens do not believe that allowing members of the LGBTI community to marry fundamentally undermines marriage. Indeed, such a desire can surely only strengthen it. If two people wish to make a public declaration of their love and longterm commitment, then their gender is irrelevant. We should remember that we are dealing here with the emotions, feelings and relationships of ordinary Australians. I am sure that there are many here in this place who feel that such issues should not be politicised, but they are being politicised. It is obvious that there is a degree of homophobia behind the position taken by the government. Homophobia, for the members' interest, is defined as a fear of homosexuals, be they male, female or transgender, and is usually linked with hostility towards them. But I ask: why the fear? There is no reason for it, and there is no reason for the bill before us, apart from a desire to discriminate against ordinary Australians based upon their sexuality. A desire to commit to spend your life with another person and to have that commitment publicly recognised is an important tradition in our current social and cultural context. The government and opposition both suggest that we should blatantly discriminate in the area of marriage. How would people react if the parliament suggested that two people could not marry because of the colour of their skin or because of different religious beliefs? Members would say: `What an outrageous suggestion.' Yet we are clearly faced with discriminatory legislation here today. This is despite the fact that on 24 August 2001 the Prime Minister stated: This is inexcusable hypocrisy, for this bill clearly discriminates against homosexuals in our community. It is, in the words of the Prime Minister, therefore unfair. Has the Prime Minister's position changed since 2001? Does he now believe that we should actively discriminate against homosexuals-against the LGBTI community? Obviously the answer is yes, and this bill is evidence of that. We have heard many worthy speeches in this debate, especially from this side of the House, on the issues of the history and status of marriage, on LGBTI relationships, on discrimination and on related issues in this country and overseas. The members for Gellibrand, Grayndler, Melbourne Ports and Fremantle covered these issues eloquently and in much detail, and I agree with many of their statements. It is therefore disheartening that the opposition will not be opposing this bill in total-that they will not be supporting those thousands of Australians in the gay community who want to live as a married couple, whether it be called a civil union or some other term, and who do not want to be discriminated against because of this. These people are not single; they are not living in de facto relationships. They are, for all intents and purposes, living in relationships as a married couple. We cannot stand here in this place and deny that. The ABS tells us that there were almost 20,000 such couples in Australia at the last census and that those numbers were probably substantially less than the real figures due to the nature of the census form, so we are talking about some 40,000 Australians at least. At this point, it might be useful to make reference to an Alan Ramsey article which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 29 May this year and which outlined just one aspect of the government's highly problematic approach towards recognition of same-sex partners. Ramsey outlined the case of Colin Hollis, a former Labor MP from the Illawarra, who went to New York to represent the Australian parliament at the United Nations in the same year the member for Makin took her now infamous study tour. Ramsey wrote:  Ramsay's article quoted Colin Hollis directly on this issue. Mr Hollis said: Hollis took his case to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 2001 but lost on the strict definition of `spouse' in the legislation. Again, the government fought Hollis all the way. This blatant discrimination is an affront to fair-minded people everywhere. For centuries, gay and lesbian people have made a phenomenal contribution to our society in all fields of endeavour. To suggest that by acknowledging gays and lesbians in marriage we will fundamentally erode the institution, and ultimately society, is ridiculous. To suggest that gays and lesbians cannot raise children with the same successful result as heterosexual people is also ridiculous. As we are all well aware, every family is different. If the government are so concerned about children having parents of different sexes perhaps they feel that single mothers or single fathers should have their children taken away from them. To judge a person's parenting ability with such a broad brush on the basis of their sexuality is ludicrous. And to suggest that these relationships are not worthy of the recognition of marriage is also ridiculous. As I have suggested, the contribution of gay and lesbian people to our community has been enormous. Despite this, we still seem to be determined to discriminate. Some are willing to give in to the rantings and ravings of homophobes. For centuries many gay and lesbian people have been forced to hide their sexuality through fear of discrimination. Let us make no mistake: this legislation sets their cause backward-back to the fifties, I would suggest, a time period that the Prime Minister is obviously very comfortable with. I believe that acknowledgment and acceptance of the legitimacy of gay and lesbian people and of their love is inevitable; the community is very much supportive of that. But the government and opposition are today making that journey that much harder.  Graham Willett, in 2000, published a book called Living Out Loud: A History of Gay and Lesbian Activism in Australia. A description of this work by Paul Sendziuk, from the Department of History at Monash University, in 2001, provides a brief overview of gay and lesbian rights and cultural acceptance in Australia-and I think it is worth bringing this to the attention of the House. According to Sendziuk, Willett provides a chronological narrative which traces the construction of a homosexual `community' and the movement towards gay `liberation' and homosexual law reform in Australia. The book's three parts titled `Living', `Out' and `Loud' broadly characterise the emergence of homosexual visibility and vibrancy between 1950 and the present day. It surveys the so-called camp scene in the 1950s, a decade in which fear of violence and arrest stifled homosexual life and any ideas of political action-and we do not want to return to those days at all. Although fear of bashing, employment discrimination and arrest kept most homosexual activities hidden, this did not prevent homosexual men or women from finding each other. By the late 1960s decriminalisation was on the minds of politicians, the clergy, newspaper editors and liberal reformers, both male and female. Not surprisingly, given the history of repression and violence, homosexuals were not among the many voicing their dissent publicly. As Dennis Altman has contended and Willett echoes, the arguments of these small `l' liberals were propelled by the emerging discourse of multiculturalism, which would also come to have a dramatic impact on public policy and attitudes concerning Indigenous people and immigrants. The first gay rights organisations-the Daughters of Bilitis and the Campaign Against Moral Persecution, CAMP-were established in this country in 1970 and, from that point on, political activism became a permanent part of Australian homosexual life. These organisations and their leaders gave the inspiration for thousands of people-gay and straight-to become politically involved. Willett keenly relates the way in which they organised community meetings, established single--issue lobby groups and ran for parliament on a policy platform of gay rights. He also notes their opposition, the leading voice of which was the Reverend Fred Nile, a member of parliament in New South Wales, and his Festival of Light organisation. In the transition from `Out' to `Loud', Willett explains how homosexual activity between consenting adults was first decriminalised in 1975 under the Dunstan Labor government in South Australia, to be followed by reform of Commonwealth and Victorian legislation in 1978 and 1980 respectively. He also charts the growing support for the `gay agenda' in the community and the way in which a visible and vibrant homosexual community-nurtured by gay businesses, gay press, gay bars and sporting competitions-emerged in Australia's two largest cities. The author cautions however against assuming that the experience of Sydney and Melbourne gay men and lesbians and other members of the community was shared by their brothers and sisters in rural areas and provincial cities, some of which even now have still to form `communities' of homosexual men and women in any real sense. I have certainly been made aware of the homophobia that has existed in the community in my electorate of Cunningham. Vile letters to the editor on this issue have appeared in the Illawarra Mercury since the Prime Minister raised the issue last year, and recently in response to my same-sex relationships bill-though I should point out to the House that the letters in support of gay marriage and gay rights have far outweighed the homophobic. This legislation does nothing to progress the rights of gay and lesbian people in this country; indeed, it deals them a blow. At present there is no definition of `marriage' in either the Marriage Act or the Family Law Act 1975. The issue of defining `marriage' in the Marriage Act was raised when the Marriage Bill was being debated in the Senate when it was first introduced in 1961. A Country Party senator unsuccessfully proposed that marriage should be defined and made a number of suggestions including:  and: The last amendment was put to the vote and defeated by 40 votes to eight. While it can be argued that for the purposes of Australian law `marriage' does not include unions between persons of the same sex, it is also true that our understanding of who can contract a valid marriage under Australian domestic law is changing. For example, the Full Family Court was recently asked to make a declaration that a marriage between a post-operative transsexual person, `Kevin', who had been born female and a woman, `Jennifer', was a valid marriage. Both a single family court judge and later the Full Family Court declared the marriage valid. The Commonwealth intervened in the first proceedings and then appealed the single-judge decision to the full Family Court. The amendments contained in schedule 1 of the bill will also mean that marriages between same-sex couples validly contracted overseas will not be recognised for the purposes of the Marriage Act. There have been newspaper reports in recent months that some Australian same-sex couples who have married overseas may seek a declaration from the Family Court that their marriages are valid in Australia. A number of overseas jurisdictions now allow same-sex partners to marry or enter civil unions. Australia is a party to the Hague convention. Under article 9, the convention obliges Australia to recognise marriages validly entered into in foreign states. However, article 14 provides: Same-sex marriages are not specified in the convention as marriages to which the convention does not apply, nor are they listed as an exception to the general obligation to recognise foreign marriages that are set out. Countries where gay marriage is allowed and where registered partnerships or civil unions are granted include the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada and the United States, where, this year, Massachusetts was the first US state to allow gay marriages. Countries considering gay marriage legislation include Spain, France and Sweden; while US states considering gay marriage legislation include California, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. It is an unfair and ridiculous situation that same-sex relationships all over this country-despite their longevity, despite their passion and love and despite their profound commitment-must be treated as `different' relationships. Australia has an opportunity here to be one of the most progressive and forward thinking in the world in relation to a whole range of issues, the recognition of same-sex relationships being just one of them. However, the government and opposition bury their heads in the sand, refusing to accept and support same-sex relationships as a normal part of Australian life in 2004. For this reason I cannot support this bill and I condemn the government for bringing it before the House."
13331,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Alby Schultz,0,LP,Hume,4," Before I make any further contribution, I want to illustrate what I have just said by reading from page 18 of the Weekend Australian from Saturday, 29 May 2004. Those of us on this side of the House know that the Australian is not a print media outlet that has any great love for the government. The editorial is headed `Gay marriage not needed'. It is rather lengthy, but I will read it in part: It goes on to say: Finally, the article said: I think that is a very eloquent editorial, and it is written in the context of the values of people like me, as I represent the majority of my constituents, knowing and adhering to the reality that marriage is the accepted bond between a man and a woman. Marriage is a bedrock institution worthy of protection. There should be no doubt about what the word `marriage' means. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that the commonly accepted definition of `the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others' is under threat. Amazingly, there is no definition of marriage in the Marriage Act 1961, despite the fact that section 46(1) of the act requires that a marriage celebrant who is not a minister of religion of a recognised denomination must say to the parties to a proposed marriage, in the presence of the witnesses, words including: The government's proposed amendment to the act will ensure that the legal position in respect of marriage is further strengthened. I think that is a classic illustration of why the government has taken the action that it has. I have listened to the contributions of members on the other side of the House with their attacks on the Prime Minister and what they say is the reason for him introducing this amendment bill into this House through the appropriate minister. The reality is this: 30 backbenchers, of whom I was one, who represent in excess of a quarter of a million constituents, went to the Prime Minister and highlighted the need to amend the current act. The meaning of marriage has also been raised in Australia recently-and the member for Cunningham did allude to that in a number of ways-including in the Family Court, in the case of Kevin and Jennifer. In this case, the court was asked to declare that the couple's marriage was valid, even though Kevin was born a woman. The trial judge found that Kevin was a man at the time of his marriage-a decision upheld by the full bench of the Federal Court when challenged by the Attorney-General. In addition, same-sex couples married in overseas jurisdictions such as Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium or Denmark may seek judicial recognition of their marriage in Australia. A notice of intent to do that was made in February this year by a male couple from Melbourne who had earlier flown to Canada to be married. It is my belief that moving away from the traditional definition of marriage would be to the detriment of our society. Marriage provides stability and is a solidly-built roof under which children can grow and be nurtured. The Australian Family Association has strongly supported this view, as has the Australian Christian Lobby. I think that we as Australians still hold dear the traditional family values that marriage implies and would like to see those values maintained and protected well into the future. As someone who has been married to a very loving, caring and sensitive woman for 42 years, I concur with my wife's sentiments about the need to protect the sanctity of marriage. Many of my parliamentary colleagues may not be aware that 16 percent of married couples are unable to have a child. As there are very few babies or children available for adoption in Australia, these married couples are forced to go through a time consuming and costly process to adopt a child from another country. The issue of adoption is centred around both the Commonwealth and the states, and the Commonwealth government does not control adoption practices. This is a matter that lies within the control of the states and territories. The government believes, however, that it is inappropriate for the Commonwealth to intervene to overturn the laws of elected governments other than in the most exceptional circumstances, and in this respect the government believes it is appropriate that the territories are treated as equivalent to the states. The government has decided that it will, to the extent of its direct responsibility under the external affairs powers, legislate to prevent adoptions by same-sex couples under the international arrangements being recognised in Australia. When these sorts of issues arise, many members of parliament are subjected to accusations by elements within their communities-and I sympathise with the member for Cunningham, who has been attacked for his views. We do, after all, live in a democratic society. But I also concur with one of my National Party colleagues, who referred to the issue of homophobia, which he and people like me are accused of when we make a comment or a statement which is in contrast to a minority view on a particular issue, such as, for example, homosexuality or gay couples.  It may surprise the House that I have a very close relationship with a number of homosexual people in my electorate-and with a number of homosexual couples. Some of them I class as very dear friends. They are good, loving people and very fine Australians, but they are also very fair people, and they understand that I have different views to theirs on some issues-and I have been attacked for some of those views, particularly those that are centred around mainstream Christian values. In fact, they support me when I make some statements. So the things we are hearing today from some members about what the homosexual community may or may not think are not necessarily the thoughts of all homosexual people or gay couples. I needed to make that comment, because that is the reality and it is the message that I have got from some of the gay people I know who live in a relationship as a couple. I also have to say that the point that I made about 30 members bringing this matter to the attention of the Prime Minister, and those 30 members representing in excess of a quarter of a million constituents, is a very poignant point that the member for Cunningham has failed to pick up on. He certainly has not picked up on it in the three years that he has been a member of this place. Unfortunately for the member for Cunningham, I think his seat will go back to the Australian Labor Party at the next election because he has got a narrowly focused view of his constituency. That is one of the reasons why I take very strong exception to people coming into this place and making loud noises about minority groups. In this case we are talking about a group of people-gay couples-who make up about 0.5 percent of all couples, married or living in a de facto relationship, in Australia. I take strong exception to people coming into this place and attacking me and to people in my electorate who represent a very small group of people attacking me for the views that I am articulating and the stand that I take on behalf of the majority of the people that I represent. As I have said before and say again today, I will face my constituents at the polling booth. They will exercise their democratic right to make a decision about whether they want me to continue to represent them in the manner that I have in the 16 years that I have been a member of state and federal parliament, and I will accept that decision gracefully one way or the other. I wanted to make that point in this place. I will not be intimidated by individuals in this place or by individuals or groups out in the electorate into moving away from the things that I grew up with, the things my father and my mother taught me about honesty, integrity and principle, and my Christian beliefs, which I hold very dear. In closing, I want to say that the institution of marriage is a very precious thing to most Australians. I am talking about the majority of Australians. I am concerned that the Australian Democrats and the Greens have already moved and voted for an amendment to the Marriage Act which will allow marriage between two men or two women. So far the ALP, the alternative government, has not supported this amendment, but this could change, especially given the ALP's recent support of a motion in the Senate calling for full recognition of same-sex couples in federal law. Traditional mainstream marriage is an enduring social institution which benefits family members and provides for stability in society. More specifically, it benefits children by ensuring their welfare not only is maximised but also is paramount. I have a great deal of pleasure in saying that I support this bill. It is long overdue in ratifying a very grey area in the Marriage Act, and I commend the Prime Minister, my party and the Attorney-General for introducing it into this House."
13332,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Philip Ruddock,1,LP,Berowra,2," I thank members for their contribution to the debate. The number of speakers who have contributed demonstrates the importance of this issue. The debate demonstrated that it is an important matter for the broader Australian community. I thank the opposition for its support for at least those amendments we proposed to the Marriage Act which seek to define the fundamental basis of the institution of marriage. I note that, in relation to the question of the government's motivation in bringing forward this bill, some have suggested that it was because the government had in mind `wedging' the opposition. I find this a particularly fascinating term, primarily because I only ever hear it being used in relation to the government when it has a different view to the opposition on a matter of substance. It is well known that politics is about difference. I have not heard it said that, when the opposition present a different view on health policy or education policy, they are `wedging' the government. We could adopt this term and get the histrionics right, suggesting with some fervour that there is something improper about having a difference on public policy. Let me make it clear that there were substantial reasons for the timing of these matters. These provisions are not about discriminating against anybody. As I have been told over and over again in the context of this debate, this is merely affirming what people understand to be the law. They have not come into the parliament and advocated that it should be something else. It should be a matter of no contest. It should be supported, and if you support it the government's motives in relation to this matter should not be impugned. We are not about discriminating against anybody. We are of the view that people can have their relationships. It is just that they cannot have their relationships ascribed the characteristic of marriage, as marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman. So the purpose of the bill is to give effect to that commitment, to protect the institution of marriage.  The bill has another provision, which the opposition is not prepared to support, so let me deal with that second matter. It relates to the question of same-sex couples being put forward as adoptive parents for children from overseas countries. The government is firmly of the view that all children should have the opportunity, all things being equal, to the care of a mother and father. That is a statement that has been made by this government. It is a statement that was uncontested by the Leader of the Opposition. That would have significant implications for bilateral relationships. It would be likely to jeopardise those countries' continuation in a program which is important to Australians who are unable to find children for adoption. I simply make the point that this issue is within the Commonwealth's constitutional competence. We are not seeking to intrude in whether the states or territories regulate adoptions in any particular way. We have dealt with that in the area which is within the purview of our responsibility. The only further point I would make in relation to this matter is that there are a number of measures proposed by way of amendment. I will deal with each of those when they are proposed in the consideration in detail stage. In relation to the second reading amendment moved by the member for Gellibrand, given the vehemence with which those opposite have attacked me in relation to my, I think, very sensible and modest interventions justifying the intercountry adoption proposal, we obviously see matters differently, and we would not support that amendment. In relation to an audit of all Commonwealth legislation and a statement that, regardless of what that audit might discover, measures that are discriminatory on the basis of sexuality might be removed, the only comment I would make is that there may be for some reasons in some parts of Commonwealth legislation valid differences that some might want to maintain."
13333,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Consideration in Detail,Nicola Roxon,0,ALP,Gellibrand,1," (1)	Schedule 2, item 1, page 4 (lines 5-9), omit the item. (2)	Schedule 2, item 2, page 4 (lines 10-22), omit the item. These amendments are absolutely critical to the opposition's view of how same-sex relationships should be treated in Australia. The Attorney-General, in his summing up of the second reading debate, highlighted how absolutely ludicrous the government's position is in relation to adoption. These amendments go specifically to the issue of adoption and seek to remove from the bill the provisions that relate to adoption. There is absolutely no argument that the Commonwealth should interfere in this issue, which is a state and territory matter. The Attorney-General goes to great lengths to explain that, because it is intercountry adoption, bilateral arrangements are involved. We are not suggesting that the provisions are unconstitutional; we are suggesting that they have the impact of interfering in an area which has always been covered by the states and territories-and which the Attorney in his speech and the Prime Minister in his press conference clearly say is a matter for the states and territories. It is ridiculous for the government to try to achieve its policy objective by implementing this ban at a federal level. It is unnecessary. The Attorney-General is being totally disingenuous by saying that this is going to threaten the whole intercountry adoption system. He could not point to one country that has indicated to Australia that they might withdraw their participation in this system as a result of the states having some power to choose other couples. What is even more ridiculous, though, Attorney, is your suggestion that we are seeking to prioritise these couples. The Attorney knows full well that the adoption regimes have very strict guidelines and that most countries require married heterosexual couples within a special age group, within a particular weight specification, with a particular religious background and so on-there are whole range of other things. To suggest that we are seeking to prioritise same-sex couples is totally wrong and totally inappropriate. What we are saying is that your government, Attorney, is trying to interfere to say that they should never be on the list. We all know that no overseas country at this point in time recognises or allows adoption to same-sex couples. We know that most of the states in Australia do not permit it. But we do not think it is necessary for the federal government to intervene in the way that it is simply to make its point about its view of what a family should look like and what it thinks is always in the best interests of the child. We do not believe that, if a child is in traumatic circumstances, if they are living in poverty or if they have been involved in a country which is war torn or has some other civil disruption, there will never been a good home for them here in Australia with a same-sex couple. That is a ridiculous argument for the Attorney to make. It is not one that we think stands up to any sort of criticism. The suggestion that it puts at risk the whole intercountry scheme is completely disingenuous. Members on the other side of the House might remember when the Attorney moved some amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act in respect of male teachers. He had the audacity to stand up in this place and say that the government had moved the amendments because it had been asked to. When we asked, `By whom have you been asked to do this?'-because the Catholic Education Office had not asked; in fact, they asked for it to be withdrawn-he said, `By my colleague the minister for education.' The government says, `We have to take action in these things because we have been asked to take action,' or, `We have to take action because the intercountry adoption system is going to fall apart'-the Chicken Little approach of `The sky is going to fall in'-but it cannot give us any evidence, any substantial request or any indication from any country that they might withdraw participation in the intercountry adoption system. Attorney, until you can convince us that there is a real reason or any real fear-rather than your scaremongering-we do not intend to support this provision in the bill. The government's view is very simple. If a state or territory says: `We have a view in relation to this, and we want to make a statement. We really do not care whether or not it affects international relationships. We are able to determine it, we are going to propose it and the Commonwealth is required to accede to it'-because, as the members opposite say, this is a state or territory responsibility-it has an impact upon our external relations. All we are saying is that this matter ought to be put beyond doubt. The Commonwealth legislates on who does or does not get a visa to enter Australia. Under intercountry adoption arrangements, where the proposers for adoption are a same-sex couple a visa for a child to enter Australia will not be granted. Question put:"
13335,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Consideration in Detail,Anthony Albanese,1,ALP,Grayndler,1," Page 4, after line 22, at the end of the Bill add: Schedule 3-Amendment of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 This is now the 23rd occasion on which I have tried through this House to achieve equal entitlements for same-sex couples with regard to superannuation. When the Prime Minister made his announcement about this latest wedge tactic with his minister who specialises in these tactics and specialises in vilifying the most vulnerable people in our community, he said that there would be changes made to superannuation to allow for people who were interdependent to gain access to superannuation benefits. The Labor Party has had a bill before this House since 1998 which would have achieved this reform. This bill, the provisions of which I have included in this amendment, has the support of the superannuation industry, the support of the Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby and other equal rights groups, the support of the ACTU and the support of the Association of Certified Practising Accountants. HREOC had a report into this issue in the case of Greg Brown, whose partner, Robert Corva, died. He had worked for the defence department. Mr Brown went to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, went through the bureaucracy and went all the way to HREOC. In his finding, Commissioner Sidoti found that this was discrimination but it was legal discrimination. This is 2004. What sort of society and what sort of parliament accept the situation that legislation can be described as legal discrimination? This amendment seeks to remove it immediately. It has the support of the private sector. The Body Shop conducted a campaign under the theme `Same Sex, Same Rights' for which they got petitions signed supporting my bill. That reflected the community's support to remove this area of discrimination. The government has spoken about interdependency. But that will still leave discrimination, because same-sex couples will be required to prove financial and emotional interdependence and they will also be excluded from some of the benefits of superannuation, such as the spouse contribution rebate. Why has the government gone down this path? It used the example of elderly sisters who are dependent upon each other. That is a legitimate issue and a legitimate area of reform, but it is not the same as reform in the area of relationships. The relationship between two elderly sisters, one of whom is looking after the other, is not the same as a loving sexual relationship between two men, two women or a man and a woman. We seek to remove that discrimination and to change the definition of spouse, but that is one step too far for this government. It says it wants to remove discrimination, but it does not want to do it openly because of some of the redneck, bigoted attitudes of those who sit opposite. We still have not seen the bill on superannuation. My amendment would ensure that change in superannuation happened and that it happened today, because reform is long overdue in this area. I commend my amendment to the House."
13336,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Consideration in Detail,Michael Danby,1,ALP,Melbourne Ports,1," (1)	Clause 2, page 2 (before line 1), table of commencement information, omit  Peter Allen's life might be being celebrated in The Boy from Oz showingon Broadway at the moment, with Australians enjoying the reflected glory on this country, but, if he were alive, this government would still not allow him to pass his superannuation on to his partner. The same would apply to Sir Robert Helpmann, Patrick White and many other famous Australians. I will not embarrass government members by naming some of their own former colleagues who would also be discriminated against. The amendment I am moving tests this government's promise that they will do something to lift the burden of discrimination from the gay and lesbian community. It follows amendments moved earlier by the honourable members for Gellibrand and Grayndler. I want to take this opportunity to say something about the honourable member for Grayndler's efforts over the years to abolish discrimination in superannuation. He has been a tireless opponent of discrimination, and I know that in this area his efforts have been appreciated by many people outside this House. My amendment is very simple. It provides that the government's amendments to the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act, if and when they are passed by the Senate, will not come into effect unless and until this government fulfils its promise to amend Australian superannuation law to abolish discrimination against same-sex couples. When the Attorney-General introduced this bill, he said that there would be legislation to remove discrimination against same-sex couples in superannuation. In other words, this legislation came as a package. The Prime Minister got to amend the Marriage Act so that he could go around the country, especially to regional seats at election time, posing as Mr Family Values while the blatant political agenda which lies behind this bill, which relates to a nonexistent problem, was to be concealed by a reform to the superannuation law. We have had that part of the government's package. We have seen the amendments to the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act. But where is the other part of the package? Where is the fig leaf to cover up this blatant exercise in wedge politics? It is nowhere to be seen. The Attorney-General said it would be introduced at `an appropriate time'. Is now not the appropriate time? I have to ask: what is holding up the government's proposal? It is not as if it is a difficult piece of legislation to draft. The honourable member for Grayndler and I have tried on many occasions, since he has been in this House and since I was elected in 1998, to introduce a simple set of amendments which would have the effect of abolishing discrimination against same-sex couples in superannuation. Each time we have been defeated. Nor can the problem be that we are proposing something radical. We are talking about money that has been contributed by employees into superannuation funds and their right to gain equal treatment regardless of whether they are in same-sex or heterosexual relationships. Honourable members opposite claim to be the party of individual rights, and particularly of the rights of property. Here we have a group of individuals who are still being denied the right to dispose of their property as they see fit. Now we are trying again to abolish this piece of unjustified discrimination. We will be watching to see how members opposite vote on these amendments. They assure us that they have no prejudice in bringing in this bill. Now is their chance to prove it by voting in support of this amendment.  I will be particularly interested to see how members opposite who represent electorates similar to mine vote on this amendment, including the member for Higgins. There are members opposite who have significant numbers of gay men and lesbians in their electorates. I think of the honourable members for Wentworth and Adelaide. There will be many voters in those seats who will be very unhappy if those members vote against this amendment and for the continuation of discrimination in superannuation. Most particularly, I am thinking of the honourable member for Higgins, the Treasurer, whose electorate abuts mine and includes Prahran and South Yarra, where many gay men and lesbians live. They are of course more affluent people than those in my electorate, and many of them no doubt have voted Liberal until now. They will discover today what their local member really thinks of them and of their right to live their lives as they choose and particularly to dispose of their property as they see fit. In short, we will find out today who are the real liberals in this House. Interdependent relationships include a wider range of relationships than just same-sex couples. There is also an intention to include provisions in relation to those people who have special responsibilities as carers where they are living in close proximity to those they care for. Neither the member for Sydney's amendment nor the amendment now proposed, which have focused only on one element of the range of measures that we are dealing with, is a suitable substitute for what the government is proposing. Question put:"
13338,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Consideration in Detail,Tanya Plibersek,0,ALP,Sydney,1," 119 Definition of marriage The amendment that I am moving relates to the definition of marriage. It is necessary to move this amendment, because the Labor Party wants to make clear that we believe that de facto same-sex relationships should have absolutely equal status under the law to de facto heterosexual relationships. They should have absolutely equal rights and absolutely equal responsibilities. This is an area where there still is a great deal of discrimination. Some of the areas in which there is discrimination include, but are not limited to, workplace relations, taxation, superannuation, immigration and citizenship, Defence and veterans' entitlements, health, aged care and social security. For example, if you are a de facto heterosexual couple the calculation of your health expenses is different to that for a de facto same-sex couple. It is absolutely wrong that in 2004 we still discriminate between same-sex and heterosexual relationships in this way. To give effect to this amendment we will need the audit of all Commonwealth legislation that the ALP have promised. We have said that we will go through every piece of Commonwealth legislation and remove discrimination based on sexuality or gender identification. I noticed earlier that the AttorneyGeneral said that this was an unwise move because there were areas in which discrimination was a good idea. I cannot believe that the AttorneyGeneral would come into this place and say that some racial discrimination is a good thing. It is absolutely wrong to discriminate against people on the basis of sexuality. How is it different from discriminating against people on the basis of their race? I am sure that he would not be arguing that it would be right to discriminate on the basis of race. This amendment is absolutely in line with Labor's history of addressing discrimination against gay men, lesbians and others. We were the ones who lifted the ban on gays and lesbians in the Defence Force. In the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, we banned discrimination against people who are HIV positive. We outlawed federal and state government interference in private sexual conduct when the Keating government passed the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994, which implemented article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This guaranteed that no federal or state government could create legislation that interfered with private sexual conduct between consenting adults. We were the party which provided lesbians and gay men with the same immigration rights as heterosexuals in 1992, when amendments were made to the Migration Act 1958 which made it possible for Australian citizens and Australian permanent residents to sponsor their same-sex partners to migrate to or remain in Australia on the basis of their relationship. However, while these are great achievements, there are still significant gaps, because de facto same-sex couples are treated differently from heterosexual de facto couples. As well as being in line with Labor's history of addressing discrimination against the gay and lesbian community, the amendment is also in line with moves in this country over time to address discrimination between people who are married and people who are in de facto relationships. Once upon a time, people who were in de facto relationships were really regarded as second-class citizens; they no longer are. I commend this amendment to the House."
13341,2004-06-17,MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Consideration in Detail,Warren Snowdon,1,ALP,Lingiari,4," I am a bit concerned that somehow or another this government does not believe there should be recognition of de facto relationships. I am most concerned to think that, even if it did, it would no doubt want to discriminate between those in a same-sex relationship and those in a heterosexual relationship. I think it is discriminatory, despite what the Attorney-General says. It is very important that this legislation be amended to recognise properly and appropriately de facto relationships. There should be no discrimination in the Marriage Act about whether or not people are in de facto relationships or whether they have been married through the appropriate forums.  I know many same-sex couples who have had longterm relationships; they have longterm commitments to one another. They are good family people. They show their contribution to our community in a way which many people in this chamber ought to be thinking about. I do not know the average length of a marriage these days, but I suspect it is around seven or eight years. It seems to me that, if most people who go into a marriage are going to have that marriage end within seven or eight years, we will have a very skewed view of families and family relationships as a result of the proposal which the government is advocating. We need to understand that families are different. That does not mean they are any less a family nor does it mean that they do not have relationships which rely upon partnerships in which people's rights are recognised-whether it is through superannuation or any other aspect of their lives. I am proud to live in a de facto relationship. I have a very loving partner and a very loving family. An honourable member-She is very tolerant!"
13395,2004-06-21,SUPERANNUATION (ENTITLEMENTS OF SAME SEX COUPLES) BILL 2004,First Reading,Anthony Albanese,1,ALP,Grayndler,1," But I am not alone. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia supports my bill, as do various private sector organisations and the ACTU. Indeed, the Senate had an inquiry into my bill for which it received hundreds of submissions in support of the bill and only three in opposition. It is quite clear that, at a time when someone's partner dies, the last thing they should be subjected to as a grieving partner is a wrangle over superannuation rights. The case for this reform is therefore very clear. The government will say that it has fixed the reform through an amendment to its choice bill, which is a retrograde bill with regard to superannuation, that came about through a deal with the Australian Democrats. There are a number of problems in that, because the government has failed to take the step of redefining the term `spouse', as my bill does, to acknowledge the fact that these days spouses are diverse and should include same-sex partners. As a result, even though the reform is a step forward, same-sex couples will still be required to prove both financial and emotional interdependence, and they will be excluded from other benefits of the superannuation and taxation system such as the spouse contribution rebate. There are other concerns about whether the bill will cover same-sex couples in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. There is also a concern about whether they will be able to benefit from the superannuation legislation, because the Income Tax Assessment Act is not being amended to allow same-sex couples to receive the same taxation concessions that are currently available to heterosexual couples. You might think that is because the government will not acknowledge that same-sex relationships can be as legitimate and important as heterosexual relationships, but a contradiction in the government's policy on this has been drawn to my attention. It is in the government's Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004. Schedule 3 of that bill, `Associating with terrorist organisations', seeks to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995, subsection 102.1(1) of the Criminal Code and to insert the following definition: The government can make the leap towards an acknowledgement of same-sex couples when it comes to the antiterrorism bill, but they cannot make that leap when it comes to superannuation. Whilst an interdependent relationship between, say, two sisters can be very important and valid-and there is argument for the need for reform there-that is not the same as a sexual, loving relationship between either two men or two women. That is not the same, and the government refuses to take that step with regard to superannuation legislation. Frankly, I am disappointed that the Democrats have caved in on this issue and have not supported full reform. The Labor Party in government will remove discrimination in this area and also in taxation, immigration and a range of areas, after a full audit of all Commonwealth legislation. This would be an important step. I commend the bill to the House. "
13526,2004-06-24,MARRIAGE AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Philip Ruddock,1,LP,Berowra,2," It is an important measure that I now introduce. The bill is necessary because there is significant community concern about the possible erosion of the institution of marriage. The parliament has an opportunity to act quickly to allay these concerns. The government has consistently reiterated the fundamental importance of the place of marriage in our society. It is a central and fundamental institution. It is vital to the stability of our society and provides the best environment for the raising of children. The government has decided to take steps to reinforce the basis of this fundamental institution. Currently, the Marriage Act 1961 contains no definition of marriage. It does contain a statement of the legal understanding of marriage in the words that some marriage celebrants must say in solemnising a marriage that: `Marriage, according to law in Australia, is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.' The government believes that this is the understanding of marriage held by the vast majority of Australians and they should form the formal definition of marriage in the Marriage Act. This bill will achieve that result. A related concern held by many people is that there are now some countries that permit same-sex couples to marry. The amendments to the Marriage Act contained in this bill will make it absolutely clear that Australia will not recognise same-sex marriages entered into under the laws of another country, whatever that country may be. As a result of the amendments contained in this bill, same-sex couples will understand that, if they go overseas to marry, their marriage, even if valid in the country in which it was solemnised, will not be recognised as valid within Australia. In summary, this bill makes clear the government's commitment to the institution of marriage. It will provide certainty to all Australians about the meaning of marriage in the future. These provisions were contained in another bill that passed this House. They were referred to the Senate, and all of the measures have been referred by the Senate to a committee for review. It would be my intention to amend the Marriage Amendment Bill now before the Senate to delete these provisions. If this bill is acceded to today, I want to make it very clear that the reason for this, without breaching any privacy matters, is that some parties have already sought recognition of offshore arrangements approved under the laws of other countries and would be seeking recognition under our law. It is the government's view that the provisions of the Marriage Act which we are seeking to enact should not be delayed and should not be the subject of Senate referral. The opposition having indicated its support for these measures should ensure-having restricted it to those matters that relate to a definition of marriage and the recognition of overseas marriages, which they say they support-that they receive a speedy passage. I invite the opposition to accede to that. I table the explanatory memorandum."
13527,2004-06-24,MARRIAGE AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Nicola Roxon,0,ALP,Gellibrand,1," As the Attorney rightly points out, the measures that have been introduced in this new Marriage Amendment Bill 2004 are measures that the Labor Party have indicated that we would agree to. But we object strenuously to the process that is being used by the Attorney. We object strenuously because the Attorney knows that the content of this bill, along with its other provision, has been referred to a Senate committee. There have been several weeks during which negotiations could have been held about the way the bill was to be treated or about its referral to a Senate committee. It is not appropriate to receive a phone call at 9 o'clock the night before, to be told that this bill is going to be introduced and then to be expected to agree to whatever procedure the government thinks suits it at the time. We can be sure of one thing with the Attorney-that is, whichever portfolio the Attorney is in there will be a crisis. It does not matter if it is immigration, it does not matter if it is Attorney-General's, and it will not matter after this which shadow ministry he is responsible for, because there will be a crisis.  The Attorney would have us believe, in the comments he has made, that the reason for needing to urgently press ahead with this matter is that, if we do not, there would be a major crisis in this country. This is because two applications have been filed seeking to have gay marriages recognised, but they are 99.9 percent likely to be rejected by the courts. I have no doubt that the Commonwealth will appear in these matters and make its views known. Frankly, I have no doubt that it is most likely that they will be rejected. It is just not credible for the Attorney to come into the House and say, `Unless this bill is passed, the world as we know it will come to an end.' We are sick of dealing with an Attorney who thinks that crisis is just a way of life. He has manufactured a crisis out of this matter. There is no crisis. The Labor Party are quite happy to deal with the content of the bill, but we respect the parliament; we respect the Senate. We believe that a process has already been partly undertaken. The community are entitled to have an opportunity to have their say on the provisions of this bill. That is the process that has been set up in the Senate. The government missed its chance, if it was genuine about this, to negotiate with us or to negotiate with the Senate about the time frame, about the process for reporting from the Senate committee or about separating out different provisions of the bill, if that is what it wanted to do. We know that we do not have the numbers to stop the Attorney doing whatever he wants to in the House. The reality is that, if those of us on this side of the parliament seek to object to the process, we ultimately cannot stop the Attorney pushing it through the House. The content of the bill is something that we do not have an objection to, and obviously we will not be voting against the bill. But we object strenuously to the process which is being used. We do not believe that there is any legitimate argument for this to be treated as an urgent matter. The Senate has already determined its program for the rest of today, in consultation with the government. It seems that the Attorney is not prepared to talk to his colleagues in the Senate to ensure that, if this is such a matter of national crisis, it will be put on the program and that there will actually be time for it to be debated in the Senate. That has not happened, and the Attorney should not expect that he will have cooperation from the Labor Party in the Senate to deal with this matter when the program has already been fixed. I might, for the benefit of those of us in this House, indicate some of the matters that are going to be debated on the last sitting day for this session in the other place. The Attorney needs to be able to mount an argument-which I do not think he can successfully do-that this is a more important matter for the future of our nation than the national health amendments, pharmaceutical budget measures, superannuation budget measures, tax law amendments, higher education legislation amendments, Treasury legislation amendments relating to professional standards, trade practices amendments for personal injuries and death, the Energy Market Bill announced as part of the government's package several weeks ago, electoral reforms, the sex discrimination amendment and antiterrorism bills.  Really, if the minister is seriously saying that it is more important to deal with these provisions-which simply confirm the existing law, for goodness sake-and that he has to stop all of the other matters being debated in this House and in the Senate, then he is not going to get our cooperation to just tip everything upside down because he has decided that there is a crisis. As I say, there is one thing that we are really sure of with this minister: wherever he is, there is a crisis. We have now learnt that that does not mean there is a crisis; it just means the minister happens to be there. We will not be supporting speedy passage of this bill through the Senate and we object strenuously to the process which has been undertaken by the minister."
13528,2004-06-24,MARRIAGE AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Michael Organ,1,AG,Cunningham,3," The government are discriminating against the gay and lesbian community-there is no doubt about that-and it is a disgrace that the Labor Party are also supporting this discrimination. The Greens do not support this discrimination. We support the gay, lesbian and transgender community in our society. We now have before us an amendment to the Marriage Act stating: In this day and age in Australia-and we are talking about Australia here; we are not talking about America, Canada or anywhere else-there are gay and lesbian couples living in loving relationships as married couples. We cannot deny this. It is not going to change. It is part of our society and we have to embrace it. It is disgraceful for the government to come into this place-and for the opposition to support them-and to blatantly discriminate against those people. Since this issue has been raised in the last couple of weeks, my office has been inundated with calls of support from the gay and lesbian community. Obviously there is some division in that community about marriage itself and the whole institution of marriage, as there is in the wider community. Not everyone wants to get married. As we know, there is a high divorce rate and there are de facto relationships as well. But a large number of people in the gay and lesbian community do not want to be discriminated against and want to live as married couples. I have stood in this House and given some examples of that. For this bill to insert this new definition of marriage with the words `voluntarily entered into for life' begs the question: if the union is `for life' in this bill then surely there must be some amendment to the Family Law Act-where does divorce come into it? The Greens cannot support this bill. It is a backward-looking measure. It is blatantly discriminatory. I will be seeking to introduce the following amendment to this bill:  (1)	Subsection 5(1): Insert 'Marriage means the union of (a)	a woman and a woman (b)	a man and a man or (c)	a woman and a man to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.' (2)	At the end of section 88B: Add: To avoid doubt, in this Part (including section 88E) marriage has the meaning given by subsection 5(1) (3)	After section 88E Insert: 88EA Certain Unions are marriages A union solemnised in a foreign country between: (a)	a man and another man (b)	a woman and another woman or (c)	a woman and a man must be recognised as a marriage in Australia It is a sad day for this parliament to be introducing such discriminatory legislation. This government seems to want to deny that there are thousands and thousands of ordinary Australians out there who are being discriminated against based on their sexuality. The minister has not addressed that issue. We have heard the Prime Minister come into this place and say, I'm not going to discriminate against anyone based on their sexuality,' yet here we have a blatant example of the government and the opposition supporting discrimination against ordinary individual Australians based on their sexuality. This simply cannot be condoned. The government are using the institution of marriage. Marriage does mean, in part, the union of a man and a woman, but, as I have pointed out, in this day and age in this country, marriage is more than that. There are individual gay and lesbian couples living in loving, caring marriage relationships, asking that they not be discriminated against in the many areas that they are-for example, superannuation, entitlements, living as married couples et cetera. It is not up to this parliament to interfere there-not at all. I condemn the government for this bill and I condemn the ALP for supporting its introduction."
13529,2004-06-24,MARRIAGE AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Second Reading,Philip Ruddock,1,LP,Berowra,2," I recognise that the member for Cunningham would like to change it. His amendment suggests that that is what he would like to do. But that is not the government's position, and we understood that that was not the opposition's position. We were of the view that the opposition-in good faith, having said that they supported this measure-would not seek to put it off, when the issues are being addressed now in legal proceedings, to have a parliamentary inquiry which would inevitably ensure that it was going to be put off for months.  Question agreed to. Bill read a second time."
13530,2004-06-24,MARRIAGE AMENDMENT BILL 2004,Consideration in Detail,Michael Organ,1,AG,Cunningham,3," (1)	Subsection 5(1):  Insert 'Marriage means the union of (a)	a woman and a woman (b)	a man and a man or (c)	a woman and a man to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.' (2)	At the end of section 88B: Add: To avoid doubt, in this Part (including section 88E) marriage has the meaning given by subsection 5(1) (3)	After section 88E Insert: 88EA Certain Unions are marriages A union solemnised in a foreign country between: (a)	a man and another man (b)	a woman and another woman or (c)	a woman and a man must be recognised as a marriage in Australia. I commend these amendments to the House because they will reflect Australian society as it currently exists in this country. As I said previously, we have thousands of non-heterosexual Australian couples living in loving, committed relationships in this country. For this parliament to tell those people that what they are doing is illegal, that it is not supported, that we are going to discriminate against them, is just not fair or equitable and it is not the right thing to do. We should be supporting all Australians. We should be making sure that we are not discriminating against ordinary Australians. This bill is clearly discriminatory. This amendment will reflect marriage as it exists in this country as we speak. Marriage has a lot of different dimensions to it, secular and religious. I think that is an important element of what we as federal members of the House need to reflect here. We cannot bring our own personal prejudices to this place. We are representing the people of our electorates, the people of this nation. With some 10 to 15 percent of the people of this nation being part of the lesbian, gay and transgender community, it is just unbelievable that this government should try to discriminate against them.  We have heard the minister say that this is not discriminatory law. We have heard the minister come into this place before and tell us that black is white and say things are not happening when we have heard from his own words the complete opposite. I take those comments with a grain of salt. I know what the people in my community believe. I know what people throughout Australia believe. There are thousands and thousands-a large number of people in this community-who support gay marriage. We are here in 2004. We have come a long way since the bad old days of gay bashing and homophobic behaviour and things like that. Hopefully we have come a long way. We are an open democracy here in Australia. We should be sending a clear message to the community that discrimination against people based on their sexuality and on homophobia is not to be condoned at all. Unfortunately, this Marriage Amendment Bill does send the wrong message out there to the community. It caters to some of those homophobic attitudes in the community and it is the wrong message to be sending. But it is a message that this government seems happy to send and unfortunately it is a message that the opposition seems happy to support as well. I commend these amendments to the House."
