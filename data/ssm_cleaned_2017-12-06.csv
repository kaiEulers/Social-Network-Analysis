48928,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Matt Keogh,1,ALP,Burt,2,"It is also about a fair go for Stephen and Dennis, who, despite being the first gay couple in Australia to marry here, under the ACT's short-lived laws, by my friend and colleague Terry Healy MLA, ultimately had to marry in Ireland. It is about a fair go for my cousin, my aunt, CT, and my cousin-in-law, Jack. It's about a fair go for my friends Craig and David and so many others in the LGBTIQ around Australia so that, should they wish, they too can marry the person they love. It is about our country legally recognising their relationships and removing discrimination against them so that they can all enjoy the same legal rights, privileges and status in our community that my wife, Annabel, and I have-because the love we share is the same as the love all these couples share too; because all Australians are equal and should be entitled to full participation in our society. That's why I voted yes in the survey and will vote yes in this parliament for marriage equality. I commend the bill to the House. "
48929,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Jason Falinski,1,LP,Mackellar,2,"I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. I do not wish to detain the House for long in moving to a vote on this matter but I did feel that it was proper to explain briefly to this chamber why I will be voting in the manner and form in which I shall be voting. I cannot say that I had some sort of road-to-Damascus experience, an epiphany brought about because someone I loved or respected or held in high regard had shared with me their experience and its injustices were so clear and the virtues so sure that they pleaded like angels, trumpet tongued, against it. The truth is, for as long as I can remember, I have known people who were gay and were treated no differently except-and this is a rather large exception-under the law.  My father had a business partner who openly lived with his boyfriend at a time when homosexuality was illegal in New South Wales. One of my good friends in the Liberal Party was Ross Barlow. I say this because he recently passed away. He lived with his boyfriend and partner for over 50 years. As he lay in the hospital bed, delirious from his long illness, he asked me if the postal ballot had been successful. Unfortunately, Ross passed away before I could answer that question definitively. Homosexuality has never really struck me as being unusual or, honestly, that different. I guess it would be easy for me to hide behind the clarion call of democracy in support of my views. We gave the people a voice and they spoke with a roar. In Mackellar, 84 percent of people voted and nearly 70 percent said yes. But I'm also persuaded, as many who have come before us have noted, that replacing the tyranny of dictators with the tyranny of the majority is no advance. Instead, I believe that government is at its noblest when it is providing freedom to its citizens, when those freedoms do not impinge adversely on any single person and are giving voice to those freedoms. To have a freedom that cannot be properly exercised is also no advance. If government is to regulate marriage then it should be regulated to ensure everyone has access to it.  As a practising Catholic, I accept that my personal views on marriage may no longer be expressed in law. However, it weighs more heavily on me that I should not use government to enforce upon others my personal views. Just as I would not want those opposite to impose their personal views on me, it is not unreasonable for them to ask that I do not impose my personal views on them. Few of us in this House are gods. And few of us always know what is good for us, as is readily demonstrated on a daily basis. So how can we presume to always know what is good for others? These choices, whether right or wrong, are best reserved for the individuals who are most directly impacted by them.  I know that there are many who are worried that their freedoms to express their beliefs and conscience openly and without undue constraint may be compromised by this bill. I'm obviously one of those people. A discussion about the inherent rights of those of conscience is long overdue. Compared to the United States, where these matters were considered and resolved some two centuries ago, Australia has much work to do. My distinct preference is for this discussion to be dealt with holistically rather than piecemeal in a bill designed to give expression to the people's voice by expanding the definition of marriage in law. As such, I support the Ruddock review as the best path towards protecting those rights both now and into the future. This parliament should always look to give as much freedom to people as possible, only constrained by the removal of a right or freedom of another. Therefore, this parliament should support provisions that protect people's rights to express their conscience, and, where there is doubt, we should sow certainty. But just as importantly, this parliament should now allow people who love each other to marry. "
48930,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Ross Hart,1,ALP,Bass,3,"I'm delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 that we have before us in the House today. This moment has been a long time coming, and I'm so pleased and proud that the time is now here to deliver marriage equality to all Australians. As a number of members have already said in this place, particularly the member for Gellibrand, there is a considerable level of frustration at the fact that all of us here in this chamber are presenting speeches on this issue. But it's very important to me to explain why it is that I am making my contribution here today.  In my home state of Tasmania, eight out of 10 eligible voters took part in the marriage equality postal survey, with 63.6 percent of them indicating their support for changing the law to allow same-sex couples to marry. Tasmania has a transformative history with respect to LGBTI rights, and it is heartening that a majority of Tasmanians are today supportive of marriage equality. Tasmania has experienced a significant shift in social and political attitudes ahead of national trends in that time. Many played their part, but I would like to recognise Rodney Croome in particular for his dignified, reasoned and principled activism over decades-firstly, with respect to removing criminal sanctions against members of the gay community and, subsequently and progressively, addressing issues of discrimination, culminating in this debate. I'm thrilled that every electorate in Tasmania returned a majority 'yes' vote. I am, however, acutely conscious that the result for many in the LGBTI community involved very significant stress, anxiety and, indeed, questioning of their very identity and self-worth. I'm very sorry that this process was imposed upon this community. I cannot begin to understand what it would be like to have my feelings of self-worth, my sexuality or my identity questioned in the full glare of the political process with the opportunity for prejudice and discrimination to be brought to the fore despite every exhortation for reasoned and respectful debate.  Nevertheless, given the fact of the survey and its sanctioning by the High Court, it was vitally important that those seeking marriage equality campaigned for a successful result. In my electorate of Bass, around 55,000 participants completed the postal survey, with 61.7 percent supporting a change in the law. My office played host to a 'yes' campaign official announcement party on 15 November. Members of the LGBTI community and their friends, allies and supporters gathered to watch the ABS deliver the result. The electorate office was bursting at the seams, with people spilling out on to the street waiting anxiously for the result to be announced. On this occasion, it was an absolute pleasure to stand by and watch as history was being made. This was a time for those with a personal interest in the matter to speak out and have their voices heard. I personally felt that this was not a time for appropriation of the result by those without that vital personal interest. I'd like to recognise the efforts of everyone involved in the 'yes' campaign and give a special mention to the Bass volunteers. This was truly an issue that encouraged people to become politically motivated. I must also acknowledge Rick Marton, Mara Schneider and everyone else in Launceston who worked hard to push marriage equality forward over the years-in particular, Susie Clarke, 'super grandma' and tireless supporter; David Broughton, master letter writer; and Ray Mostogl, business leader. A big thank you also to the team from Party in the Paddock and LUSY Productions for getting enrolments together in the lead-up to the survey.  My office had a group of around 20 volunteers knocking on doors, hosting street stalls, making calls and putting up posters. It was a small group, but each and every member displayed such a passion and enthusiasm for the task at hand. I would particularly like to acknowledge those people for whom the 'yes' campaign was their first experience of campaigning. Jacob, Robyn, Mikala, Petra, Elaura, Katrina, Hilda, Harriet and Cordelia, thank you. I well recall campaigning in one shopping centre. We identified what we called the 'nanna factor'-a succession of elderly people who exhorted us that it was now time for marriage equality. That factor was proved time and time again in many electorates across Australia, with 133 electorates recording a positive response. The overwhelming positive outcome of the postal survey was a clear directive from the Australian people to their parliament: 'Just get this done.'  There are those who seek to minimise and belittle the result. For example, some are claiming that less than 50 percent of eligible voters have supported a change in this legislation. I absolutely reject any such contention. The government made it clear that, in introducing legislation to conduct a plebiscite, it was seeking to fulfil an election promise. It indicated at that time that, if the plebiscite was unable to be passed by the parliament, it would conduct this postal survey on the same principles. Whilst the survey didn't require any enabling legislation, it is instructive to review the defeated bill to conduct the plebiscite. The 2016 bill was never expressed to require a majority of all enrolled voters. It is absolutely ridiculous and intellectually bankrupt to claim that either the defeated plebiscite or this survey required a majority of eligible voters to support the proposition. Rather, it is significant that Australians have provided leadership to the parliament on this issue-leadership that the Prime Minister could not deliver. Those everyday Australians have told us, loud and clear, that they want to live in a country of fairness, of tolerance, of equal rights for all. Of the cohort who voted no, there were some who expressed their views by reference to their religious beliefs without expressing any sense of intolerance towards the LGBTI community. I acknowledge and thank them for their representations to me and the courtesy with which they made those approaches, which were many, both for and against the bill. Unfortunately, there were many who, in the name of religion, wished to revisit many of the antidiscrimination provisions introduced by each of the states and the Commonwealth over more than 20 years and, in particular, seemed to argue for a return to the dark days when same-sex relationships were not acknowledged and in some cases had potential criminal consequences. My firm view is that, if it is necessary and appropriate to provide for express freedoms, this legislation should not be amended so as to provide for those freedoms. As a number of people have already said in this place, as a matter of principle, piecemeal amendment of this legislation will do a disservice both to the LGBTI community and to any religious seeking the protection associated with religious beliefs and rights. It is significant that there are already state based and federally based antidiscrimination provisions, not only within antidiscrimination legislation but also within legislation like the Fair Work Act, which prohibits discrimination with respect to particular characteristics, including religious belief. This means that in most cases a person may not be the subject of discrimination with respect to a religious belief or religious practice. In contrast, there are express exemptions with respect to some discriminatory issues-in particular, sexuality-which benefit those who claim a religious connection, such as a church or a school which is based upon religious principles.  I appreciate that, during the survey, many in the 'no' case argued that freedom of speech with respect to the exercise of religion was already under threat, both here and overseas, and would face a further threat if same-sex marriage was made lawful. My understanding is that many of the examples given of supposed consequences of same-sex marriage, particularly in the international context and in the context of a notorious case involving the Catholic archbishop of Hobart, involved conflict between antidiscrimination provisions that benefit both those who are LGBTI and also those who are religious. Those arguments appear to me to be misconceived, because they relate to the right of the LGBTI community to be free from discrimination, not to the right to be married.  There is no doubt that the LGBTI community deserves the right to live their lives free from discrimination, as do those who profess religious belief. I absolutely believe that it's possible to practice deeply held religious beliefs without in turn engaging in conduct which, for example, from section 17 of the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Act: ...offends, humiliates, intimidates, insults or ridicules another person ...  But as I've already said, parliaments have already decided that in certain limited cases those who profess a particular religious view shall be free, notwithstanding antidiscrimination law, to act in a discriminative manner with respect to employment of persons. I'm quite prepared to consider the outcome of the inquiry which is to be undertaken by Mr Ruddock. The irony of the right of politics effectively seeking the introduction of a bill of rights with respect to the exercise of religious freedom has already been identified by the member for Goldstein in several public statements. I firmly believe every family deserves the stability and recognition marriage confers, and that is why I stand here today in support of this legislation. I commend the bill to the House."
48931,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Nicolle Flint,0,LP,Boothby,2,"We're here this morning after a late night last night, continuing to debate this Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 because the Australian people have had their say on same-sex marriage. Their decision was clear. A majority want a change to the traditional definition of marriage, and that is what we will deliver. We, the coalition government, promised the public that they would have their say in a decision that was reached before my election to this place. We took our policy to the Australian people at the 2016 federal election and, by voting to elect the coalition government, they voted for our approach. The Prime Minister and the government fulfilled our commitment to carry out a same-sex marriage plebiscite. We were unwavering in our promise to give Australians the right to contribute to the debate and to have their say. I wish we could say the same about those opposite, but they blocked us at every step and in every way. We, however, fulfilled our promise so that each and every Australian could express their view on this historic change and reconcile themselves to this historic change.  This is a very important point. Everyone who wanted to have a say had a say, and their voices were heard. This was a democratic process. The unprecedented turnout for the voluntary survey-far above what those opposite and some commentators expected-reflected the strong will of voters on both sides of the debate to express their views. The Australian people voted to change the traditional definition of marriage and we, as their elected representatives, are now acting to honour their decision. Just over 60 percent of the Australian people voted to change the traditional definition of marriage. This result was reflected in my electorate of Boothby, and I will honour their decision and that of the Australian people. It is now the job of this place to implement this decision and to legislate to change the definition of marriage. However, it is also the job of this place to ensure that the views of almost five million Australians, who voted for the traditional definition of marriage, are maintained and respected too.  Many of these people hold strong religious convictions. The fundamental tenets of their faith were formed thousands of years ago and have not wavered through the centuries between. We owe it to these people to protect their religious beliefs and freedoms. In fact, as the Treasurer expressed so beautifully in his contribution to this debate, we owe it to our nation. It is my hope that everyone watches or reads the Treasurer's contribution, especially those opposite. It's one of the most thoughtful and impressive speeches I have seen presented to this place. As the Treasurer outlined, our Christian values informed the founding of our Federation. I will quote some of the Treasurer's words because it's difficult to say it better:  ... at section 116, our Constitution deliberately afforded the protection that 'the Commonwealth shall not make any law for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion'. This is the religious inheritance of our Federation-our Constitution, from more than a century ago. If we ever act in dissonance with these founding principles, I believe it will be to our nation's great peril. This is not to say that Australia is a nation with an established state religion. Thankfully, it is not. We are, thankfully, free of such a restriction on our liberty. Such freedom should not be used, though, as a weapon against the importance of faith, belief and religion in our society or as a justification to drive faith and religion from our public square. At the same time, protection of religious freedoms cannot be used as a cloak for religious extremism that undermines our very freedoms. We may be a secular state but we are not a godless people to whom faith, belief and religion are not important. Quite the contrary: it is deeply central to the lives of millions of Australians.  The Treasurer goes on to say: Separation of church and state does not mean the inoculation of the influence of faith on the state. The state shouldn't run the church and the church shouldn't run the state. In fact, the separation of church and state was set up to protect the church from the state-not the other way around-to protect religious freedoms. And this is what we must do. We must protect freedom of speech, freedom of religion and religious beliefs, just as I believe we must protect the other institutions that have enabled these freedoms and have made us one of the most respected, respectful and peaceful nations on earth: our system of constitutional monarchy, our Westminster parliamentary tradition and our Judaeo-Christian principles that have informed our wonderful society. On this issue, the mandate of the Australian people is clear: introduce legislation that changes the definition of marriage. However, to pass legislation that does not encompass fair and comprehensive religious protections would put at risk the freedoms we hold dear and the democratic values that we all represent. This is why I will be voting to honour the result of the plebiscite but supporting the amendments to be moved by the members for Cook, Deakin, Mitchell, Canning and Mallee. "
48932,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Susan Templeman,0,ALP,Macquarie,3,"The question of same-sex marriage turned out to be a very simple one for me a few years ago, thanks to my two children. I asked myself, 'If one of them falls in love with someone of the same sex and they want to be together for the rest of their life, why shouldn't they have the choice to show their love and commitment by getting married?' The answer is clearly that, as a mother, I do not want to see discrimination against either of my children, so this has not been a difficult debate for me. I have not agonised, and I have not been swayed by counterarguments. My electorate has known my views since 2010. I can't wait to vote yes to marriage equality.  But I'm not sure that it would have been such an easy question for me and my generation 30 or 40 years ago. In 1978, Jan Forrester, who now lives in the upper Blue Mountains in my electorate of Macquarie, participated in the first Sydney Mardi Gras parade. New South Wales police violently broke up the march, arresting 53 people. And in fact my husband, who joins us in the chamber today, recalls, a few days later, being part of another group protesting the arrests and fleeing from police in Taylor Square, in Sydney. The Sydney Morning Herald, of course, published the names of those arrested in that first Mardi Gras, effectively outing them, resulting in many losing employment and being ostracised by their family and their friends. It was a different time. And I'm sorry that it has taken us as a nation so long to move away from that time and that so much harm has been done to so many people along the way. Many are not here to see how far we have come, and this parliament should be sorry for that.  Today, however, I am proud. I'm proud to vote for the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 for Craig and Mark, of Lawson, who are looking forward to getting married and having their relationship of 20 years recognised under Australian law. I'm proud to vote for this bill for Tony and Kenn, of Wentworth Falls, who've shared each other's lives for 23 years. When Kenn needed a kidney transplant, Tony was the donor. And there's nowhere else in the world they'd rather be getting married than here in Australia. I'm proud to vote for this bill for Hawkesbury resident David Briggs, who was told by the previous local member that if he wanted to marry a man he should move to England; for Kelly and Birgitta and their young son; for Tim and Matt, of Blackheath, who have been together for 11 years; for Andrew and Colin; and for Kirrily and Wenone, from Leura, who travelled to New Zealand to marry and for whom the phrase 'wife and wife' means so much. For them, I'm proud. For PFLAG, for rainbow families, I am proud. For Jack, who has put his heart and soul into this campaign for the electorate of Macquarie and is part of my team, I'm really proud. Sixty-three point nine percent of my community voted yes. It voted yes to love. It voted yes to equality. It voted yes to inclusion. It voted yes to ensuring that every member of our community, whether they be gay or straight, has the right to marry. People did not, however, vote to wind back discrimination legislation. They did not vote to provide wide-reaching exemptions to the right to marry. They voted for love, and I intend to respect and uphold that decision.  Religious freedom is important, but nothing about this bill threatens the religious beliefs of those in my community. This bill merely extends fundamental legal protections afforded only by marriage to same-sex couples and their families. It seeks to afford these relationships the same status under the law that my husband and I share, that my straight friends share. This bill removes state-sanctioned discrimination, but, most of all, this bill is about fairness. It's about equality. It is about equity. We didn't need a plebiscite or a survey that has hurt a lot of people in my community. I am still aghast that those opposite could shirk their responsibility as members of parliament under our Westminster system and outsource their decision to a mass survey. This parliament claims to be concerned about mental health, and I'm right to be worried about the mental health impacts caused to the LGBTIQ community, particularly among young people. But we had it, we won it and now we're here.  I want to recognise the young people within my electorate. We had over 800 people under 25 enrol to vote or update their details in the postal survey, and 18- to 19-year-olds in Macquarie made their voices heard at a rate significantly higher than many of those older than them. They turned out to street stalls, they called for equality, they got to train stations at 5 am to hand out flyers and get out the 'yes' vote. Young people have been galvanised by this issue like no other, and I'm incredibly proud of how hard they fought for this change. In particular I want to recognise the LGBTIQ young people of my electorate. To them I say: I know you've been hurting a lot recently and I know how hard this postal survey has been and some of the hatred that has come from it. I've stood with you as you explained what marriage equality means to you to people who were not really interested in opening their hearts to you. Please know that your community respects you for who you are and for who you love. Know that so many of your teachers, your peers, your families and your representatives love and care for you and think that you should be entitled to every happiness that heterosexuals are entitled to.  To the army of volunteers, especially those in the Hawkesbury: thank you for stepping out of your comfort zone and talking to your friends, neighbours and total strangers to get the 'yes' vote out. It was an honour to work with you. Thank you to the leadership of local LGBTIQ support group Pink Mountains, who have made the mountains an inclusive home for the LGBTIQ people. Peter Hackney, Kevin Hardwick, Tiphanee Athans, Kylie Watson-there were many others involved. I want to thank Malcolm McPherson, Katoomba local and New South Wales Co-Convenor of Australian Marriage Equality, who's been a leader of this campaign since 2005 and has come to Canberra to witness this historic event. I thank Audrey Marsh, originally from Blackheath, who was one of the state organisers of the campaign. Thank you to Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains councils, who both flew the rainbow flag. Your efforts are finally rewarded. Finally this place can do its job and vote for marriage equality, and then I look forward to the weddings where Australians in love get to bring this legislation to life. "
48933,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Stuart Robert,1,LP,Fadden,2,"I rise in this chamber to speak to the private member's bill Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, which seeks to change the age-old definition of marriage. In the postal survey my electorate voted 61.8 percent-ostensibly the state and national average-in support of changing the definition of marriage. There is no question that that is a clear mandate for this parliament to make a change, and I respect that mandate as I respect the will of the Australian people. Our democracy depends on that fine point. I let my electorate know from the outset that I'd be voting no in the postal survey, whilst also stating that, if the electorate voted yes, I would not stand in the way of a bill passing through the House. Today I'll honour both pledges as I honour the democratic will of the Australian people and sincerely respect its institutions.  I have voted on two issues in the last decade in this House to deal with same-sex couples. I fully supported the Rudd government's legislation to remove all discrimination against same-sex couples so they'd be treated in ostensibly the same manner as de facto heterosexual couples. A lifestyle should never set the stage for discrimination. I voted no to the bill to legalise same-sex marriage in the Gillard government. My voting record has been consistent with my strong Christian value set as outlined in my maiden speech a decade ago: the view that marriage was defined by God as 'a man and a woman united together and becoming one'. This basis, definition and meaning of marriage for me has not changed-a man and woman, made powerfully equal in the image of God, created to be together within the sanctity of marriage to raise a family and literally populate the earth. This view, while clearly no longer the majority in our nation, remains a view held by millions of Australians and literally billions of the earth's citizens. It's a view that deserves to be heard and understood. It's also a view that deserves to be protected. That's why I'll be supporting all of the proposed protection amendments today. It's also why I'm strongly supporting the current review into religious protections led by the Hon. Philip Ruddock and I'll be campaigning strongly for the result of that review to come into this House as all-encompassing enabling legislation in 2018.  Those churches that marry according to the God-given instruction in the word of God, the Bible, must be free and able to marry according to that God-given mandate. They and their facilities must be protected. Likewise, other faith groups, as they marry within their faith based norms based on the marriage of one man and one woman, deserve similar protections. Furthermore, parents who send their children to faith based schools must be assured that their children will be taught the tradition and standing of marriage according to their faith. Schools' ability to teach the traditional God-given standard of marriage must be protected.  Freedom of speech and freedom of religion are foundational and fundamental principles of our nation. They were the principles that much of our nation was built on. My mother's forebears were one of the 10 very first original free-settling families that arrived in Australia in 1802 from Scotland and from England. They arrived as free passengers on the convict ship Coromandel 14 years after the First Fleet. They came seeking religious freedom and independence as they were so-called non-conformist in England; they did not conform to the prevailing religious view at the time. These families would build the first non-conformist church and school at Ebenezer on the Hawkesbury River six years after arriving in New South Wales. This church still stands and is the oldest in our nation, testimony to our nation having been founded on religious freedoms. As a conservative Pentecostal Christian, today I remain strongly non-conformist and, as is their legacy, I still hold the torch for religious and faith-based freedoms. These families had watched their friends being dragged to the hulks and ultimately transported for the religious crime of not conforming to the prevailing view of the time-for there were no protections for them to worship in England and Scotland as they believed, no protections to marry as they believed and no protections to educate their children as they believed. These families, my family, came to Australia in search of freedom and independence that their forebears, often betrayed and imprisoned, had cherished, longed for, hoped for and prayed for.  This lack of protection for my forebears began 140 years before these first 10 pioneering families left England to seek religious freedom in Australia. In England the Clarendon Code of four acts-the Corporation Act in 1661, the Act of Uniformity in 1662, the Coventicle Act in 1664 and the Five Mile Act in 1665-removed all protection for religious freedoms. The combined act of the Clarendon Code was that any worshippers who did not adhere to the 39 articles of the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer were called non-conformists and their religious meetings were outlawed, and any meetings or gatherings were punished with prison for the first and second offence, and transportation for the third offence. Indeed, the MP at the time, Samuel Pepys, wrote in his very famous journal after watching men and women of faith hauled to the hulks and dragged to transportation. He said:  They go like lambs, without ... resistance. I would to God they would ... conform, or be ... wise, and not be catched! Furthermore, my ancestors, those nonconformists, were debarred from holding any municipal offices or places of trust in the state or the military. Their children could not attend Oxford or Cambridge or receive a degree. They could not be married except under the tenets of The Book of Common Prayer, and their children could not be registered at birth unless baptised by the Church of England. Back then, as a nonconformist Pentecostal Christian, I could never have gone to RMC Duntroon or held a commission in the military or served on military operations overseas or stood here as a member of parliament, not because of my citizenship but because of a difference of expression of faith in the grace of Jesus. This is what happens when religious freedom is not protected. The Toleration Act of 1688 would provide some relief, as did the repealing of the Conventicle Act in 1689. However, the provisions of the 1662 Act of Uniformity were only modified and partly revoked by the Act of Uniformity Amendment Act 210 years later, in 1872. Indeed, history tells us that in 1793, nine years before my family embarked on that fateful journey of the first free-settling families and 70 years after the Clarendon Code, five politicians were tried and found guilty of sedition for having the temerity to campaign for universal suffrage and parliamentary reform. All five were transported to Australia-political martyrs, unfortunately, standing for freedom.  This was the backdrop, in 1802, of the first 10 free-settling families, 18 adults and a staggering 20 children aged one to 11 on a boat no bigger than a Manly ferry, arriving into one of the harshest climates known at the time. One of the families knew the captain of the Coromandel, hence their choice of ship. They were persecuted nonconformists, at least five of them in the same non-conformist church in England. They all left everything they knew. They left everything they loved to seek freedom from religious persecution. They despaired of finding any protection in England and Scotland, so they sought to come and build into a new nation where freedom of faith was axiomatic and where fear of being dragged into the dock because of one's religious views would never again rise. Two hundred and sixteen years later, that same call for religious freedom once again finds voice. There should never be a time again when people of faith cannot believe or marry within their faith ordinances under fear of persecution, reprisal or the courts. That is not who we are as a nation or how we were settled. Protections are important. It is folly to think that the perversions of the past cannot be revisited on the promises of the future. They can be and they will be, unless faith based beliefs and norms surrounding marriage, children and education are protected by law. I, like all of us here, cannot foretell the future, but history is a portent of what the future will tell.  So I commend the amendments to the bill to the House, as I commend the Ruddock review of religious protections that will report next year. I commend the future 2018 religious protection bill to the House, noting that marriage was defined by God in the very cradle of civilisation, the Garden of Eden, where mankind was created. I also recommit myself to the task started by my family 216 years ago to continue to champion religious freedoms, rights and protections in our great nation and to hold that torch of freedom of faith for my generation."
48934,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Justine Elliot,0,ALP,Richmond,4,"I rise to speak in support of this marriage equality bill, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. This is truly a great day because, with the passage of this legislation, it means that love wins. This is a bill and this is a debate that are essentially all about equal rights and fairness. The bill and parliament's support for it have been a very long time coming, and this is a day for which many Australians have worked so hard. It's a historic day for our parliament and, indeed, for our country.  I support marriage equality, as I believe that everyone should be able to marry the person they love. It's as simple as that. I voted for marriage equality when it came before the parliament in 2012 and I'll proudly vote in support of it again. What a great day it was on Wednesday, 15 November, at 10 am when we learnt that Australians had voted for equality; Australians had voted for love. It was a great day for LGBTI Australians and their families and friends, and a great day for our entire community, because extending and expanding any human right enriches all of our lives and our entire society. As I said, this campaign's all about equality and rights. Fighting for equality and those rights were huge numbers of people right across the nation, who were able to deliver such a great result. In total, 7.8 million Australians, in a historic and overwhelmingly positive vote, said yes, and this was carried in every state and territory. One hundred and thirty-three of the 150 federal electorates recorded a majority 'yes' response, with a resounding 61.6 percent across the country voting in support of marriage equality. I'm very proud that, in my electorate of Richmond, 67.9 percent of people voted yes, recognising that equality matters. Indeed, my electorate had one of the highest numbers of 'yes' votes in New South Wales.  In terms of the campaign, I particularly want to acknowledge the activism of young people during the survey. So many of them got involved in a campaign for the very first time. They got on the electoral roll. They had conversations with family and friends. They campaigned hard. They worked hard to make this happen, because it mattered. I also want to commend the Equality Campaign for their tireless work in recognising that all citizens have a right to marry the person they love. Their campaign comprised more than 15,000 volunteers who made over a million calls, knocked on over 100,000 doors and distributed more than a million stickers, 60,000 placards, 250,000 posters and five million leaflets. What an amazing effort! They helped organise the largest LGBTI rights rallies in Australia's history. I want to also commend the more than 2,000 organisations across Australia who registered their support for marriage equality. This great result demonstrates overwhelmingly that our families, friends and colleagues in the LGBTI community deserve to have their committed and loving relationships recognised under our law.  I've told the House before about friends who've had to marry overseas because they weren't able to be lawfully married here in their own country. I've spoken before about Wil and Paul from Mullumbimby, who were married under the British flag at the British consulate in Brisbane. I thank both of them for their continued advocacy for marriage equality in this country. Indeed, Wil's enthusiasm and support is truly inspirational. I've also told the House the story of two of my constituents and good friends, Julie and Cas, who were married in the United States in 2015. One of the most exciting aspects for them was the fact that they received a congratulatory message from then President Obama. I'd like to read that message to the House: Congratulations to you on your wedding day. May this special time be blessed with love, laughter and happiness. We wish you all the best as you embark on your journey together, and we hope your bond grows stronger with each passing year.  Sincerely, Barack Obama and Michelle Obama. This meant so much to them: the President of the United States endorsing and congratulating them on being married. At the time, Julie and Cas highlighted that this was in stark contrast to the current situation in Australia. I said in the House, in my original contribution: If the White House can turn rainbow, then surely this House can do it too. Just recently some very good family friends, Mary and Amanda, were married in Hawaii, and it was indeed a beautiful wedding, right next to the beach, as the sun was setting, at Waikiki. The ceremony so eloquently showed the couple's strong love and commitment to one another. It also captured the truly stunning magic and charm of Honolulu. We were so pleased to have been invited to share this special occasion with Mary's and Amanda's family and friends. Like all weddings, there was lots of good fun and laughter, but it did highlight that they should have been able to lawfully have this great occasion, their wedding, at home, at any one of the equally stunning locations we have here. With the passage of this legislation, they and others will soon be able to rightfully get married in Australia. We in Labor opposed the plebiscite, the postal survey, for very good reasons. We opposed it not just because of the cost but because of the damage we knew it would cause and, in fact, did cause. It was distressing to learn that across Australia there was an increase of between 20 and 40 percent in calls to many LGBTI helplines and mental health services. It was upsetting to hear about the number of unauthorised and factually-incorrect leaflets distributed by the 'no' campaign and the many cruel emails and some social media posts. We opposed the survey because we didn't want to put people through the pain that we knew they would inevitably suffer because of the survey. We wanted this decision to go to the parliament, to have the determination made here.  We didn't want the postal survey, but when it was forced upon us we fought passionately for equality and the right for all Australians to be equal under the law. Quite frankly, it was not right that Australians were asked to vote on whether their fellow citizens deserve equal rights. It was hurtful and insulting to so many of those in the LGBTI community. But once the decision was made and the postal survey was in place, we in Labor were committed, rightly, to campaign very strongly for this great result, and I commend everyone I know in my area who worked very, very hard to make sure we had a resounding 'yes' vote-which was returned. A lot of people in the community worked extremely hard because we wanted to make sure we had a strong voice and we had a strong result, which did occur. Of course, the recognition of same-sex relationships is an issue for many people; it is a struggle that has gone on for decades, and it's been a very painful journey over a long period of time for many people and for a diversity of reasons. It has been very harmful and very hurtful. Indeed, it has been very harmful and very hurtful for many young people as well; it has been very difficult and challenging for them in terms of coming out to their family and friends about their sexuality.  I'd like to take a minute to reflect on an issue relating to young people-that is, the issue of youth suicide. I want to do that from the perspective of my former job as a general duties police officer. As a police officer, one of the jobs my colleagues and I attended and investigated on far too many occasions was, very tragically, suicide involving young people. I know for a fact that on many occasions those young people had committed suicide because they were either being bullied because they were gay or because they were yet to come out and tell their family and friends, and were fearful of the rejection and discrimination that they may face. Of course, what is most tragic about youth suicide is the lost potential, the lost dreams, the lost ambitions. We as individuals and communities and governments have to do better. We must do better. This is a very real debate. It's about how people will be affected. It's about young people's lives, and we should always be very cognisant of that; we should remember that all the time. That's why all of us, as community leaders, have a responsibility to speak out regularly and publicly to support younger people and send them a very positive message to let them know they are valued, to let them know their relationships are valued and to let them know their families are valued. The passage of this legislation does send such an important message about equality, and it's a particularly strong message that same-sex relationships are valued and they're recognised by the community. That is also what this legislation does. I'm proud of voting yes when it comes to this legislation, and I'm very proud that my electorate of Richmond overwhelmingly voted yes as well, which is certainly what people had said to me right throughout this campaign. Indeed over many years, many people in my community had certainly wanted to see this parliament address marriage equality and pass this legislation-particularly from the viewpoint of making sure that everyone's human rights were recognised.  I'm also very proud of my country for voting yes to equality, and doing so in such overwhelming numbers. It's wonderful. I certainly look forward to the number of weddings that will allow same-sex couples to declare their love as equal under the law. How wonderful that will be. And of course I'm very much looking forward to the number of weddings to be held in the most beautiful part of Australia, northern New South Wales. We look forward to many joyous occasions and many weddings. It already is the most popular part of Australia for weddings; many people go there for their weddings, so we are looking forward to so many more wonderful celebrations. Today in this parliament we have a remarkable achievement and, indeed, a historic event. It's a great day to be celebrating that love wins. It is wonderful, and I commend this bill to the House."
48935,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Mark Coulton,1,Nats,Parkes,4,"I rise today to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 that's before us. I actually voted no in the question that was asked in the postal survey. I guess I get to that point from my upbringing, from the community I live in, from the people around me and from my strong belief that marriage between a man and a woman has held Western civilisation in good stead for a long time. But, I've got to say, in the 10 years since I've got into this job and represented a large part of western New South Wales, my outlook has changed and broadened. I understand that life is not as simple and quite as black and white as some of us might think it could be. I have had conversations and I have built friendships with many same-sex couples right throughout my electorate. I have great respect for them and I have a great respect for the struggle that they've had over the years.  I have said that I would respect the wishes of my electorate and the wishes of the Australian people and so without hesitation I will be voting yes for this legislation. I believe that the clear majority of Australians support this change. The majority of my electorate support this change, even though the majority is not as high as in the rest of Australia. There's a large number, probably 40,000 or 45,000 people, in my electorate who voted no and so, with respect for their concerns, I will be looking at the amendments as they come through in the final stages of this bill and looking at the need to support religious freedoms, educational freedoms and the right of parents against discrimination. But, regardless of where that leads to, I'll be supporting a bill that represents the question that was asked of the Australian people. I think the idea of giving Mr Ruddock the imprimatur to look at issues that might arise is quite a good one. But the Australian people were asked a question and they delivered an answer. I will vote to reflect the answer they gave, and I will be supporting this bill. "
48936,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Emma Husar,0,ALP,Lindsay,2,"I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. As one of the only seats in Western Sydney to vote yes, I want to place on record today the pride I have for my community who did so. I am proud that every day I come in here and speak of having the best people, who roll up their sleeves and work hard to get stuff done. This was an exceptional result for our community. I know that many people are unaffected personally by the discrimination which has prevented people in the LGBTI community from being married. It didn't affect everyone, but we had a large voter turnout. So to the people who weren't affected but who participated and supported the rights of everyone in our community, I want to say thank you.  Although I will always argue that discrimination affects us all, and all should be involved in honourably participating and counting when it comes to ending discrimination, I am also the first member to hold the marginal seat of Lindsay and declare my support publicly for marriage equality. I note that the former member, now out of office, holds a very big opinion, but she holds no power or weight. It's such a shame that she didn't provide any leadership on the issue when it counted or when it could have made a difference. Leadership is critical in this discussion. I didn't seek election to sit on the fence, or sway in the breeze or be swept up in popular decision making; sometimes hard and difficult decisions need to be made. Not every decision will please everyone all of the time but we must always do the least harm when making decisions. As a marginal seat holder, it would have been much easier for me to say nothing and do nothing, but that amounts to me being nothing-a zero contributor in this debate-and I didn't seek election in a hard-fought battle to do that. I want things to change. I want ours to be the best country, with the most generous hearts and open minds; not afraid to make change based only out of fear. I do accept that changing stuff, remodelling the status quo, is scary for some people and that we should never, ever make a decision based on fear, division, scaremongering or the spreading of mistruths. This is why leadership in this is important. This wasn't an easy process, and many difficult conversations were had with people who wanted to talk about everything other than marriage equality-children of LGBTIQ Australians, their family structure, what's taught in schools and unicorns-although I never disagree with talking about unicorns. But marrying bridges was how ludicrous this public discourse actually became!  To those people who involved themselves and engaged respectfully, I say thank you. After spending most of my life advocating, standing up for people and fighting for our community, I saw this debate as being no different from the other things that I have done: fighting to end inadequate disability services; making sure public places didn't discriminate against people with access issues; standing up for, and giving a voice to, people who are homeless in our community; and ensuring their needs are met. So, when it came to ending discrimination for so many people in Australia who needed it, there was no difficult decision to make. I'm a Catholic-my children are also baptised-and I grew up respecting the Bible. What I learnt was to treat people with respect and with dignity and with inherent worth, no matter who they were. I accept that not everyone voted yes-that was their right-but religious freedoms are protected adequately by this bill. To all the people who voted no, I offer this: when we held Lindsay's 10th Welcoming the Babies event, recently, over 80 families came. It was during the thick of the marriage equality survey. A few days before it, my office received one of the saddest phone calls. It was from a mum, one of the two mums of a baby in our area who was registered to attend this event in a public place-at the local Westfield, in fact. She called to say they wouldn't be coming. They were not comfortable coming along because of the debate that was currently underway and the scrutiny placed on their family, their lives and their love for each other. She said: 'We don't feel safe. We're feeling a little bit vulnerable in our community right now.' This made me incredibly angry, but it also made me overwhelmingly sad that, in 2017, two adult women in our own community felt the pain, rejection, persecution and judgement so badly that they excluded themselves from a community event. Nothing in the Bible or my religious teaching ever said that this was okay, no matter who you happened to be. To those mums, I say this: I hope you feel safe, more accepted and part of our community, once and for all, when we pass this bill and finally end all the forms of discrimination that you have endured.  I say to my friend and basketball teammate Sam and to her partner, Kirsty-I never miss an opportunity to mention basketball in here!-that I have never felt more ashamed as a person than when I stood next to you and your boys under the big 'no' message painted in the sky at our children's basketball presentation. It was a hateful reflection of discrimination that your love and your family could be so demeaned at a community event and in such a public display. That moment will stay with me forever. Worse than that were the judgemental conversations that we overheard, the judgement that spiked and how you must have felt, which would have been incredibly difficult. As always, though, you handled it with grace and dignity. To your boys, who had to endure that among their peers: I am so sorry that the attention and the value of your mums' love for each other is so hard for other people to accept.  I offer this to those people who think their freedoms are being trashed by creating a more equal society. To the families of those who didn't make to it see an end to the last form of discrimination levelled at our LGBTIQ community because their loved one could no longer withstand the hurt, the hate and the harassment: I can only imagine that this victory is bittersweet as, for years, you were forced to watch your loved ones accept the hate and bullying that LGBTIQ people have had to endure; they have been five times more likely to die by suicide than those who are not in the LGBTIQ community. There are those whose shoulders carried the weight and suffered as a result of discrimination. And there are those who never lived to see the day when their love was finally accepted and recognised. I want us all to remember those people and their grieving families and never forget the battle it has been to get here. I want us all to remember those who paid the ultimate price for simply being who they were. And with not just this discrimination but with every single piece of discriminatory practice we still involve ourselves in-most notably, those against our first nations people-let's remember this debate and how it feels to end discrimination finally and move forward as a community ending it now rather than later. There is so much more power in inclusion and acceptance and diversity.  To my gay friends in committed relationships-Dan and Chris; the men we met at dinner; Devillers and Craig; and my comrades Steve and Hayden-whose love has been solid for years: congratulations to you on withstanding hate for so long and also on finding someone to love. Thank you for standing up for those people younger than you, less experienced and still questioning their sexuality, for whom this debate has been tough.  Since the announcement of this survey, I have been concerned for the welfare of all of the young people who aren't yet old enough to have been in long-term relationships. There has been a spike in mental health referrals of about 40 percent since the announcement of the survey and, for this reason alone, I never supported the use of $122 million of taxpayer funds to conduct an opinion poll on other people's love, care and respect for one another. I will always resent that it was done. I cannot understand why other people feel that it is their right to pass judgement on the relationships of other people. I do, however, take heart that the overall sentiment of Australians is positive, that our country is in front of the parliament and government, that this government is behind and that it's those in here playing catch-up with what our communities actually want. So, to the young people in my community and right around Australia who have been struggling to figure out their own sexuality and to understand why the storybook tales of living happily ever after with someone of the opposite sex didn't make sense to you: please take heart that they have had their say and they voted overwhelmingly to accept your love, your diversity and your sexuality. To the young people who I have the pleasure of knowing, Mitch, Mat, his partner, Mat-not confusing at all!-Elissa, Kate, Vanessa and Chauntelle: I look forward to watching your relationships and your love blossom as this country finally matures.  To my colleagues who led the way long before I got here: thank you for being honourable and progressive-in particular, Penny Wong, Louise Pratt, Julian Hill and those opposite for whom the debate is personal. Sometimes, as much as we try, politics is personal. I know something of that and the toll that it takes. Thank you for your courage to be yourselves and share your talent and your skills with us. Lastly, to Nita Green and Sally Rugg, two of the unsung heroes of this campaign, for whom this survey was deeply personal and also confronting at times: thank you for your tireless work for those in the LGBTI community, to make them feel accepted, and for teaching those who don't accept and respect other people's love how it's done. I'm incredibly proud to know you both. As I always say, no freedom till we're equal-damn right I support it. "
48937,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Josh Frydenberg,1,LP,Kooyong,1,"In my electorate, the people of Kooyong have spoken loudly in favour of same-sex marriage: 63,592 people, or 73.7 percent of responses, voted yes, well above the national average of 61.6 percent and the Victorian average of 64.9 percent. Kooyong had the fifth highest 'yes' vote in the state and the equal highest participation rate, with Goldstein, at 86 percent. Despite the doubters, the postal plebiscite has been a huge success and given added legitimacy to this important social reform for our country. Everyone has had the opportunity, as I have had, to have their say and to do so in a respectful, democratic way. It is now the job of the parliament to act on the will of the people.  At a personal level, I am very pleased, as no doubt many in our community are, about the result, as I have undergone a journey on this issue. Initially, I was hesitant about the need for change, but, after meeting and hearing from so many constituents about their own personal experiences and relationships, I have recognised that there is a need to move forward. I met with parents and grandparents of gay children, siblings with gay brothers and sisters, and gay couples who were deeply in love, not to mention the many people who were in heterosexual relationships who came to speak to me on behalf of their gay friends. It has been an issue that has cut across all demographics, irrespective of age, religion and race. I remember the passion and the purpose of a delegation of Kew High School students who, with more than 200 of their classmates, had signed a petition supporting change-not to mention the strength of Father Chris Middleton, rector of Xavier College in my electorate, one of the most prestigious Catholic schools in the country, who said:  In my experience, there is almost total unanimity amongst the young in favour of same-sex marriage, and arguments against it have almost no impact on them. ... ... ... They are driven by a strong emotional commitment to equality, and this is surely something to respect and admire ... They are idealistic in the value they ascribe to love, the primary gospel value. Just today I met with Jacqui Tomlins and her partner, Sarah, who, together with their beautiful children, Corin, Scout and Cully, are here in the chamber. They took the extraordinary step of getting married in Canada, and have raised their children in my electorate. I've had an ongoing discussion with Jacqui and Sarah since first meeting them soon after I was elected back in 2011. After being together for 25 years, they are so excited about this prospect of soon being legally married in Australia. What Jacqui and Sarah exemplify, like so many others like them, is a lifelong, loving commitment to each other, and there is no reason why this should not be recognised as a marriage under our law. Their marriage in no way diminishes mine. In fact, it strengthens the community as a whole and the institution of marriage. Sir Robert Menzies, a former member for Kooyong, who no doubt lived in a different time, where views may have been different on this particular issue, said:  I do not believe that the real life of this nation is to be found either in great luxury hotels and the petty gossip of so-called fashionable suburbs ... It is to be found in the homes of people who are nameless and unadvertised, and who, whatever their individual religious conviction or dogma, see in their children their greatest contribution to the immortality of their race. The home is the foundation of sanity and sobriety; it is the indispensable condition of continuity; its health determines the health of society as a whole. This is what Jacqui and Sarah and so many like them represent: the health of our community by the strength of their family and the love in their home. What I have felt as a parent-and no doubt what every parent wants for their children-is simply for them to have a life of love and happiness. To have this is a blessing, and we should wish this for everyone. I do also accept that, while nearly eight million Australians voted yes, nearly five million Australians voted no. They did so for a variety of reasons, including matters of faith. We need to be at all times respectful of these views and the strength with which they are held. I do believe in the need for some protections in the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 and will be considering these on their merits, particularly around parental rights. And it is disappointing that those members opposite have not provided all their members with a free vote in both the House and the Senate.  We have come far in our community over a number of years in removing discriminatory provisions, whether they relate to medical benefits, tax, employment or superannuation. And soon, in this place, we will be removing the discrimination against same-sex couples in relation to marriage. My message to those who seek to formalise their union in marriage: we respect you; you belong to the community; we do love you. And now this is a time to rejoice in the fact that the Australian people have spoken so loudly. This has been Australian democracy at its best, and now our community will be much stronger for the future. Thank you."
48938,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Matt Thistlethwaite,1,ALP,Kingsford Smith,1,"I'm very proud to report that in the recent marriage equality survey 81 percent of people in Kingsford Smith participated, and 64.1 percent voted yes in favour of marriage equality; that is above the national average. I'm honoured to be here today to represent our community's voice on this very important issue, and to cast my vote in favour of marriage equality. It's an uplifting way for this parliament to finish the year and I'm very proud to represent our community's voice on this issue.  I have been a long-time supporter of marriage equality. I voted for marriage equality in 2012 when I was a senator when that bill was brought on in the Senate. But, like many, I wasn't always a supporter of this issue. My views changed in the late 1990s, when my brother, Chris, told me and our family that he was gay. That changed my view on everything. I saw this issue, and many other issues for the LGBTI community, in a different way, through a different lens. I began to see the discrimination that existed in many parts of our society towards gay and lesbian people. I began to see that this issue was a breach of human rights. I began to see the misery and unhappiness that was being perpetrated upon LGBTI people in our community by the nature of our laws, and by the way our culture and society worked at that time. And I saw the effects that that had on people's physical and mental wellbeing. And I couldn't understand how denying the right of two people who love each other and the expression of that love through marriage could prevail in Australia. I saw the effect that that was having on our fellow Australians. So I changed my view in the late 1990s about this issue and became a supporter of marriage equality. But at the time I was well aware that I was still in the minority in terms of Australia's views. But the great thing has been watching the shift in the views of Australians over the course of the last decade and the feelings and sentiments and the changes in those feelings and sentiments towards gay and lesbian Australians, and the advances that we have made as a society. I was very proud when the previous Labor government, the Gillard government, removed about 80 pieces of discrimination in various Australian laws, led by the Attorney-General at the time, Robert McClelland, to remove discriminatory parts of our laws related to superannuation, taxation and health.  It's been pleasing to see the cultural and social change in Australia around this issue. If you look at the gay mardi gras that occurs in Sydney every year, when those who were first involved in that mardi gras participated in it, they were arrested by the police. Their names were published in TheSydney Morning Herald and great shame and burden was brought upon those people by those actions. But the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is now one of Sydney's greatest events. It's a highlight on the Sydney event calendar, a great tourism boon and an economic powerhouse for Sydney and this nation over the course of that week. Australia has changed for the better over the course of the last decade on this issue. It's now time that the Australian parliament caught up with the Australian public and the rest of Australia and also changed for the better. It's time to eliminate one of the final pieces of discrimination that exist in our laws-the right of gay and lesbian people to express their commitment and love for one another through the sacrament of marriage. Marriage is the pinnacle expression of love in our society and in our laws, and it has been denied to so many because of how they were born and because of their sexuality. At its very heart it is discrimination. It is unfair. It pervades a feeling that people don't belong. It creates distress, shame and guilt. The Australian people now want to change this. They want to remove the discrimination, the hurt and the suffering. They want to let LGBTI people know that they belong. You are a part of our society and you deserve the right, like every other Australian, to express your love for one another through the sacrament and the law of marriage. The Australian people want you to live happier lives. We're saying to the gay community that you have the right to express your love through marriage, like every other Australian, and it's incumbent upon this parliament to deliver that change. I'm firmly of the belief that we will do this over the course of the next 24 hours. In six months time, in a year's time, in two years time, we will look back and think, 'God, what was all the hassle and fuss about?'  To those in the Kingsford Smith community who voted no, I respect your decision. There are many reasons why people hold views and have voted no in this survey. I've had many conversations with people in our community about those reasons. I've replied to all of the letters and emails I've received on this issue. I have been respectful and pointed out the reasons why I have been a long-term supporter of marriage equality, why I will vote for equality and why I voted for it in the past in the parliament.  Many of those who contacted me told me they were voting no on the basis of their faith and religious beliefs. I want to say to those people that I support the notion of freedom of religion-it's enshrined in our Constitution, in section 116-and I support the right of churches to refuse to solemnise a same-sex marriage. But to those who are concerned about this issue I say that the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 provides the necessary and adequate protection for those religious freedoms. In fact, it is very clearly pointed out on the first page of this bill, which states: It is an object of this Act to create a legal framework:  ......... (c) to allow equal access to marriage while protecting religious freedom in relation to marriage. It can't be any clearer in those words, and the details contained later in the bill provide that protection for religious freedom. It couldn't be any clearer, and this bill comprehensively protects religious freedom. On that basis, there is no need to amend it further. There is no need for this parliament to amend what is proposed here today, and the amendment moved by the member for Warringah should not proceed on that basis. In conclusion, I thank the LGBTIQ community of Kingsford Smith for the dignity, the strength and the courage that you've shown throughout the period of this survey and particularly those who've been campaigning on this issue for decades. In the lead-up to the issue of the plebiscite coming before the parliament, I sat down with members of the Kingsford Smith LGBTI community and I said to them, 'What do you want me to do in terms of my vote in the parliament on the issue of a plebiscite?' They were very clear. They didn't want the plebiscite to go ahead, because of the hurt and the fact that the rights of Australians were going to be determined by a public vote. That was new ground for this country. I respected that view, and I said that I would vote against a plebiscite in this parliament. I stand by that view and I think it was the right view to hold. I thank those who had the courage and conviction to contact me and to point out their views on this issue. I particularly thank those who've been campaigning on this issue for decades: those that faced persecution, those that lost their jobs because of their personal views on this issue. Your courage and your conviction have been vindicated. And I want to give a special mention to Alan, who is in the gallery today and has travelled all the way from Maroubra to be here to see this historic vote. Alan, thank you so much for the work that you've done in our community on this issue. I hope you get to enjoy the Australian parliament voting in favour of marriage equality over the course of the next 24 hours. You're a great representative of the views of many in our community.  Finally, I thank the people of Kingsford Smith for the respect that they've shown each other during the course of the debate and, importantly, for voting yes in such overwhelming numbers. It really is why I love representing the community that I grew up in and that I have been a part of for my whole life. I'm very, very proud to express their views and cast my vote in support of marriage equality in this parliament. After that, I know Kingsford Smith and Australia will be a little bit happier. We'll all go into the Christmas break feeling a little bit better about ourselves, and that is a great thing. I'm very, very happy to commend this bill to the House."
48939,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Angus Taylor,1,LP,Hume,4,"I did not come into politics to be a cultural warrior. I didn't come into politics with the intention of imposing my morality on others. I most certainly didn't come into politics to lead the charge, one way or the other, on the question of same-sex marriage. I had other objectives in mind when I decided to abandon my first career for a parliamentary career. Mostly I came here to strengthen Australia as a country offering extraordinary opportunities and freedoms to all our citizens.  I don't consider my personal view on the issue of same-sex marriage as more or better informed than anyone else's. Each and every one of my constituents has their own view about this matter, and I have always thought, 'Who am I to judge any person, let alone any constituent, on this question?' Same-sex marriage is a personal, individual question of values. Each person, whether for or against, has views on the matter formed by his or her own life experiences and is capable of reaching an opinion on the question of same-sex marriage without any expert assistance whatsoever. We do so by reference to our own moral compass. Some people do so by reference to a religious conviction, others without requiring a religious framework at all. As I said, I judge no-one on this matter. There are valid moral arguments on both sides of this debate. Anyone who cannot acknowledge that is essentially, I believe, a deeply intolerant person. For this reason, since before I was even preselected to run in Hume back in 2012, I said that I would follow the views of my electorate on this issue. That was well before any idea of a national vote on the issue was even on the table. When the idea of a national plebiscite arose and then turned into a postal vote, I immediately committed to voting in the parliament in accordance with the national vote in order that a national vote not be frustrated.  Now, I acknowledge that my approach is at odds with the Burkeian proposition that in a representative democracy in the Westminster system: Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. This proposal that a representative does not and should not capitulate on every matter to authoritative instruction from his electorate is a very good rule of thumb, but in rare issues of pure morality and values where no expert opinion is of any assistance, where it is a matter of pure personal judgement, such as it is in this case in my view, I believe the sound idea is to seek to follow one's constituents rather than to lead them.  I congratulate the 'yes' campaign on their win, and I fully accept that the nation and my electorate have had their say and have voted yes. For those who have argued in favour of this for a long time, including old friends of Louise and me, I offer my sincere congratulations. In accordance with my pledges in connection with my own constituency, and in accordance with the national vote, I will support the passage of the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 through the House. I personally voted no. I do have strong Christian beliefs-these have informed me throughout my life, and they will always guide me-but the decision to vote no did go beyond this. We've seen heinous acts against people because of their sexuality, acts that should never ever be repeated. I don't want to see similar acts against those with strong beliefs, often religious beliefs, about the definition of marriage. We've seen these things happen to good people who take a different view on the definition of marriage in other jurisdictions. People have been harmed as a result of their contrary views about same-sex marriage. We know that people have lost jobs, have been kicked off boards, that charities have closed down, that faith-based schools have had their registrations threatened, that fundamentalist Christians have had their businesses destroyed because they take a different view. They have been harmed merely for taking a different view and expressing it. This, in my view, is an intolerable situation in a representative democracy, just as bullying based on sexuality is intolerable. I will always fight against both.  Central to my personal vote was Labor's intransigence and clear intention to deny its members a conscience vote on speech and religious freedoms and parental choice. We know that roughly the same number of Australians who voted yes also want the protection of the freedom of those who believe in a traditional definition of marriage. The Smith bill does not offer adequate protection to those who voted no or the very large proportion of reasonable, fair-minded Australians who voted yes, relying on the promise that we would protect people who took a different point of view. So I believe that this should be a bill for all Australians, both those who voted yes and those who voted no. This has the potential to be a unifying moment for all Australians.  So I will support sensible amendments to protect the freedoms of those who believe in a traditional definition of marriage. I expect these amendments will cover a range of issues. Most importantly, they should include protections for freedom of speech, protecting people such as Archbishop Porteous in Tasmania, who simply expressed his deeply held beliefs, despite state legislation limiting free speech in this area. The amendments should protect charities that favour the traditional definition of marriage against attempts to take away their status recognised by the government. The amendments should protect employees who have a traditional definition of marriage. They should not be, in any case, victimised for their beliefs. The amendments should include freedom from being required to express or associate with or endorse a statement or opinion about marriage which is inconsistent with a person's or organisation's genuine religious or conscientious convictions about marriage. The amendments should include freedom for parents to choose how their children are educated on this important issue. In Australia and in jurisdictions overseas, the experience is that individuals and organisations that support traditional marriage can and will be subjected to discrimination and detrimental action because they hold, express or lawfully act on these convictions. Unfortunately, as I've said, the international experience shows that, unless changes are made, disputes and lengthy, costly litigation are absolutely inevitable. Interestingly, we are seeing a Supreme Court case in the United States being heard, as we speak, on exactly this issue.  In all common law countries other than Australia, there are statutory or constitutional bills of rights that provide for freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I don't believe in bills of rights. But the point I make is that protections exist in all of these countries. We have the ability to put them into specific legislation-not a bill of rights but specific legislation-to provide equivalent protections for this country, just as there are in Canada, the United States, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It's crucial to note that the proposed amendments that I have outlined in my speech protect individuals, businesses and organisations which support traditional marriage against discrimination and detrimental conduct that has been initiated against them. The amendments do not license supporters of traditional marriage to discriminate against same-sex married couples or people of same-sex orientation in any way that is not already permitted under Commonwealth law. The only exception to this in the amendments is the discussion on the non-minister or marriage celebrants which extends the Smith provision to be consistent with the Senate select committee's report and, of course, international law.  We should support this bill but we should also support amendments that provide for genuine protections of religious belief, freedom of speech and parental choice."
48940,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Cathy McGowan,0,IND,Indi,2,"A story in The Border Mail, my local paper, on Tuesday, 16 November, said: 'Remember when gay meant happy? Well, that was yesterday'-a full page, with rainbow colours. There was 'elation as gay couples finally feel acceptance'. 'The people of border and north-east have spoken along with the majority of Australians demanding marriage equality. With 63.1 percent of Indi electorate voting yes in the same-sex plebiscite, voting in the north-east was higher than the national average of 'yes' votes of 61.6 percent.' In Farrer, my neighbouring electorate, it was lower, but still a majority of 55.2 percent. The border LGBTI community gathered in Wodonga for the result, with most describing it as a 'sense of relief'.  Colleagues, today in this House I join my voice with those of the Senate, the Attorney-General and others, in saying that there is no place for discrimination in my country. In my speech today I'd like to focus particularly on young people in my electorate and the role they have played in the Indi vote. I'd like to share with you some of the lessons learnt. I'd also like to make a small note about organised religions and the role they have played and I'd like to finish with some personal observations of this campaign. But I will start with the young people in my electorate of Indi. I want to make a huge call-out and thank you. I would particularly like to reference Georgina Ridley, who, in April 2013-when I first put my hand up to stand as the member for Indi-organised to have a meeting with me and her year-12 year and said, 'Cathy, my friends and I will support you, but first: what's your opinion about marriage equality?' And I was stumped. Of all the things that we could be talking about, why was this important? But Georgina was persistent. She said, 'Cathy, this is really important to us.' So I said, 'Of course I support marriage equality.' And I think in those words I really didn't understand what I was opening myself up for. Georgina and her friends then got organised.  I have to say the reason why I'm in this parliament today is because the young people of north-east Victoria organised. They wanted a member of parliament who would stand up in this place today and vote yes. Sure, there were other issues, but that was the defining one. Georgina and her friends made videos, and they did social networking and, I have to say, they became politicised. The wonderful thing is the politicisation of the young people in north-east Victoria doesn't mean they all support me but it does mean they pay attention to politics and they pay enormous attention to what this House does and says. So my 'yes' vote is particularly for the young people of north-east Victoria. I hope that you take great courage in what you have done and you apply that energy and enthusiasm equally to climate change, to our environment and to making sure that this country becomes and reaches its potential to be fair and equitable to everybody. And, in acknowledging the young people, I'd also like to bring to the attention of the House the work of the Victorian government, and particularly Ro Allen as the Equal Opportunity Commissioner for the terrific work she did with the rural and regional LGBTI roadshow. I would like to thank her and the Victorian government for supporting and encouraging the young LGBTI community of Victoria as this survey took place. Ro, I acknowledge you and thank you for your work. I love the work that you do.  The next group of people I'd like to briefly address in my presentation today is the Anglican Church in Wangaratta. I request leave to table a letter from the Bishop of Wangaratta and I'd like to speak briefly to it. Leave granted. Ms McGOWAN: It was written on 15 November and is signed by the Right Reverend John Parkes AM, Bishop of Wangaratta, an Anglican bishop. In his letter to me, he shares great wisdom and encourages me to vote yes. I would particularly like to bring this to the debate. Of the Anglican Church, he says, 'It is fair to say that we have not always undertaken the task of sensitive listening well across our church. On occasions we have been more ready to talk to, or perhaps at, rather than listen to our brothers and sisters. And some of our language has been less kind, less respectful and less dignified. Words have power, and wrongly chosen words can do damage.' In referring to organised religion and the role it's played in this debate, I want to put out a call of recognition particularly to the churches in my electorate. We have had disagreement on this topic but that doesn't mean we don't bring to bear that fundamental Christian tenet of 'love your neighbour as yourself'. And I think we've got a lot of work to do in our community in how we can actually enact that in all ways, shapes and forms. I'd like to think that we could let the argument end and that we could move on to a place of choosing our words carefully and actually listening to each other as we make our community, particularly in north-east Victoria, one where that gospel message of 'thy kingdom come' actually exists in our community and where we do love each other as the call of Christ is for us. We have some work to do there, I think.  I'd briefly like to talk about my personal experience in this campaign. Like many others in the House, this is a lovely opportunity to be able to talk about what I have learnt. In referencing my personal experience, I want to talk about the journey I have been on from when Georgina first asked me if, as a politician, I would vote for marriage equality, to the personal growth that's happened to me as I've had to change many of my fundamental precepts. This is because it's not just about marriage equality; it's actually about gender and how we express gender in our community. I have always been a feminist and I have always-since I was 12, I think-discovered that my brothers and my sisters perhaps got treated differently and that the men in my family behaved differently to the women. I have always struggled with what it was about me being a woman that made me different. Why couldn't I be accepted without a gender attached? And it was a huge fight in my growing up not to be seen as a girl or a lady. I wanted to be seen as myself and to be able to make my way in the world.  As I got older, and with the wisdom of other people in my life, I have come to understand that being a woman is my competitive advantage and I work with it. But the idea of defining someone by their gender still irks me. I don't like it when people say 'boys and girls' or 'men and women'. I really want to be accepted for myself. Here I want to say how much I appreciate my young nieces and nephews-and just let me point out the sexism of that phrase, 'nieces and nephews'. Where's the non-gendered description for children of your sisters and brothers? There isn't one, but there's 'cousins', which is non-gendered. Anyhow, to the nieces and nephews of my family: thank you for your patience and tolerance as you've taught this old aunt a great deal.  Here's what I want to say to the House: one of the big things that young people have taught me as this debate has gone on is that there's such a thing as gender fluidity. It's a spectrum. There are some people who are clearly male-female attached. There are other people in our community who are clearly female-female or male-male attached and there are other groups of people who are much more fluid. As I have gone on this journey with young people not only in my family but also the gender identity group in Wodonga and the other young people who have taken me into confidence, I have come to understand how complex it is to manage gender fluidity. I want to put on the record that I have learnt a lot, and I'd like to share a few of those learnings with the House today because it's not only about marriage equality; it's about how we in our lives move to accept people whose gender definition is different from ours. The little bit of learning I'd like to share with my colleagues today is about pronouns. As this program was going on, some of the young people in Wodonga and some of my nieces and nephews said, 'Cathy, you really need to understand about pronouns.' I said, 'What is it about pronouns?' They said, 'You know how you talk about 'he' or 'she'?' I said, 'Yes.' They said, 'He is a man and she is a woman, but some of us don't fit those categories.' My poor old mind went into overspin: how could you not be he or she? And they took me on a journey so that today I can stand in this place and say that I get pronouns. Now I'm much more tactful, I hope, and say to people who are gender non-defined, 'Tell me your preferred pronoun. How would you like me to refer to you?' as opposed to making the assumption that they are male or female. When they share with me their preferred pronoun, letting me know that they might be transgender, genderqueer or gender fluid, they are giving me an opportunity of trust. Some people use a gender pronoun that identifies them as he or she. Some people use gender neutral pronouns that don't identify them as male or female: ze or ey. Some people change their pronouns. It's a bit like how you change your name when you get married. Some people change the use of their pronouns. This can cause enormous resistance. People like myself say, 'But you're either/or.' But in fact they're saying, 'No, we're not polarised.'  Why is this important and why do I bother to bring it to the House when we're talking about marriage equality? Because, for me, this legislation is not only about same-sex couples; it's about two people, however they define themselves. I've learnt, as I've moved through this, is that it's not up to me to do the definitions but to respectfully ask the people I'm talking to. At the end of this discussion, having been taken on this really important education program, I got to be super conscious of formal documents. Now, when it says 'male' or 'female', I look for 'other' because I understand there are a significant number of people-not necessarily young people-in my community for whom 'other' is the appropriate box to tick.  In bringing my comments to a close, I want to say how important this discussion has been for me as a discussion of listening and understanding-also, how grateful I am that I have had the opportunity to go to most of the churches and the elder groups in my community to listen to them and to their objections to this legislation. I am with you. I will work with you to create in our communities love, understanding and tolerance. But I also will stand in this parliament and argue as long as I can for equality and for people to be accepted and treated as they need to be. I think we've taken a really good stance today on marriage equality and I'm looking forward to the rest of the debate, when all the LGBTIQ community know that they are accepted, that they can choose the pronouns that they want and that they will be welcomed into our community not as they, not as other, but as us. So to Ivy, to Flick, to Maggie, to Leah, to Eliza, to Ben, to Franny, to Fergus, to Max, to Mia, to Anika, to Sarah and to all my nieces and nephews: thank you for bringing me on this journey, and I commit to stay with you for the distance. "
48941,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,David Gillespie,1,Nats,Lyne,4,"The plebiscite on marriage is a coalition initiative, and it has allowed the whole nation to have its say on whether the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry. As we all now know, the answer to that question-79.5 percent of the nation made the choice to have a say-was a resounding yes. Because 61.6 percent of voters said yes, the private member's bill we have before us now, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, is being debated. A resounding majority said yes-7.8 million people-and 4.8 million said no.  I was among those who said no. In my state, New South Wales, almost 58 percent said yes and 42 percent said no. In my electorate of Lyne, 55.3 percent said yes and 44.7 percent said no. As I've already announced in my local media, I respect the view of the whole electorate and will not obstruct the view and sentiment of the majority of the electorate. I will respect their decision because it marries with the majority of the state and the nation. But I must also respect the views of the roughly 45 percent of voters in my electorate who said no. I have gone through my public, political and representative life holding the view that marriage is a foundational institution of all societies, defined by biology and heterosexual reality, and that it reflects the need for the human race to reproduce itself for our species to exist. Protecting the family unit, the weak and children is the basis of the family unit and it has stood the human race well. That never changes. But society has had a different view on what marriage is, and I will respect that.  The campaign has been mostly very civil and respectful; but, for some, respect has been a one-way phenomenon. Unfortunately, there were very aggressive responses to anyone who held the minority view in this case. There were threats of litigation or loss of employment. There were choruses of public shaming, which was meant to intimidate the minority who held, and still hold, traditional views on what marriage is. Respect and tolerance for opposing views are what I have always espoused. Unfortunately, what we saw in some sectors during this campaign was gross intolerance from those who were espousing tolerance. As a nation, we need to sort this problem out. We should use this as a unifying and uplifting moment rather than a source of continuing inimical discourse and frustration. To get unity across the whole nation is a really important issue that I will pursue. Like I said, I will not obstruct the majority view of my electorate, but we do need to respect the views of individuals, parents, churches, schools and charitable organisations so that they know that they can continue to hold and have the freedom to hold their views and express their beliefs and values and not be sued or defunded on the basis of them manifesting their longstanding practices and beliefs.  The central tenets of Western liberal democracies are freedom of expression, thought, association and religion. Parental rights are amongst those, but they are not just a tenet of Western civilisation and Western liberal democracies; it's a feature of human life and the human race that parents have always guided their children and controlled their education. Once they're adults that's a different matter, but we need to make sure that those phenomena and those rights are respected. So there will be amendments brought forward in this debate later, and I will be speaking in favour of them. On my discussions around the parliament, it appears that they won't get the support numerically. As many people have said, politics and what happens in place are manifestations of basic arithmetic. But we should not allow people to use this bill to suppress those rights that I have spoken about or to use it as a subsequent wedge to justify implementation of other practices and other agendas besides purely allowing same-sex couples to have a marriage ceremony and to have it called marriage. We don't want it to be a subsequent wedge to justify implementation of radical agendas such as the agenda to de-gender society. We have to have the clear understanding and the regulations and laws in place for the concerns of everyone and so we do generally have genuine tolerance for these opposing views. They're not mutually exclusive. We can have both. It's not one or the other. But we are now by this bill going to make it possible that people of the same sex can marry. I would also like to remind people that we are not the only people who have advanced the cause of same-sex couples. Before we met in this place, in the period when John Howard was the Prime Minister, in federal legislation and state legislation there were 84 pieces of legislation changed to remove blatantly discriminatory practices, to clarify rights to inheritance, for legal recognition of civil unions of same-sex couples achieving de facto status and protections under the law and for matters of intestacy and inheritance. So many of the things that needed to be done have already been done, but this will complete the circle of what the majority of the nation, the state and my electorate want to happen.  I have to respect the views of my whole electorate. The 'no' vote was not small; it was 45 percent of the electorate. I can't ignore their concerns and I can't become a hypocrite and then go against the things that I have always espoused and believed, but I won't obstruct the passage of this bill. It is a historic period in the time of this nation, and I'm very happy for all those people who advocated for 'yes'. It has lifted a cloud over a lot of their lives, and so in that regard I'm very pleased that it is where it is. But I am who I am and my beliefs remain what they are. Thank you."
48942,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Andrew Leigh,1,ALP,Fenner,1,"I have spoken half a dozen times in this parliament in support of marriage equality. As an economist I know we're often faced with public-policy decisions that involve trade-offs-one group made better off while another group is made worse off. This Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 debate, to my great delight, not one of those debates. This is a moment where a group of Australians will be made better off. Australians in same-sex relationships will have the opportunity to wed, and no-one will be made worse off. Heterosexual marriages, like my own, will not be weakened. Indeed, some may be strengthened, given that, as we know, some heterosexual couples have held off tying the knot until marriage equality becomes reality.  At the heart of what we're debating today are the stories-stories like Greg and Lanny's, who wrote to me and showed me a picture from their wedding day on Lake Okanagan in Canada. They wrote to say that, after 23 years of partnership, they'd tied the knot in a ceremony that Greg said was everything they'd ever hoped for. Ian and Roger told me of getting married in the UK after being together for 40 years, and Ian recounted to me that he'll never forget his late mother crying tears of joy on him and Roger finally being married after so many decades of engagement. These couples should have the right to marry here in Australia and not have to travel across the world to the other advanced English-speaking countries which, almost without exception, have now made same-sex marriage a reality. Another constituent, Alan, has been with his partner for 15 years. While he doesn't wish to marry, he feels his partnership has been devalued by being excluded from that choice. As he says: 'Legislation has an educative effect. As long as the Marriage Act excludes same-sex couples, I feel that it says that these relationships aren't as real or valid as heterosexual relationships.' Exclusion, in his words, 'isn't a victimless crime'. Having laws that tell people that they are worth less than others is one of the factors that leads to mental ill health and higher rates of suicide in the LGBTIQ community. We've seen, through this needless survey, an increase in calls to mental health support groups such as ReachOut.  Then there are the couples for whom marriage equality comes too late. Janis, a retired reverend of the Uniting Church who was never afforded the joy and rights that come with marriage, told me that her life partner passed away three years ago, and, in dealing with her partner's will, she was forced to declare herself 'never married', rather than the way she feels-widowed. Marriage equality isn't just about rights for LGBTIQ people; it's about all Australians living in a society they celebrate. Upon becoming engaged to her fiance, Miranda, from Lyneham, expressed her deep frustration and disgust that her mother-in-law-to-be and her partner, and her uncle and his partner, wouldn't be able to express their love in the same way she that could, simply because they were gay.  As we look into the future, we can celebrate being a country that not only accepts but celebrates our diversity. Eight years ago, Pierre Roux arrived in what he rightly calls 'this incredibly amazing country', and last year he became an Australian citizen. He tells me he has had the most amazing journey to date and made beautiful friends, and he has found that one and only person he loves and wants to spend time with. He proposed in April. Now they're waiting to marry in the country they both call home. Marriage equality is a necessity for the wellbeing of Australians and for their families. Anne-Marie dearly loves her grandchildren and her family. To her granddaughter Lily, there is no distinction between each of her grandmothers. She can't wait to be the flower girl at her grandmother's wedding.  For my own part, I served for a year as associate to Justice Michael Kirby, who has been with his partner Johan van Vloten for many decades. I learned from Michael Kirby more than anybody else, apart from my parents, and I hope that he and Johan will soon have the opportunity, if so they choose, to tie the knot. In my own family, I think of my uncle and his partner, who will be directly affected by this. There are so many friends, including people here in the ACT, who will be directly affected by the decision. I think of our Chief Minister, Andrew Barr, and his partner, Anthony Toms. I think, too, of couples such as the 31 same-sex couples who actually tied the knot four years ago next week under the ACT's short-lived marriage equality laws, which were then struck down when the Attorney-General, George Brandis, challenged those laws in the High Court. A constituent of mine from a local Catholic college wrote to me in the following terms. She said:  My name is Hannah Mason, I am currently attending Merici College, Braddon. ... I have decided to write you to strongly express my support for same sex marriage. Love is love. We should equally recognize the relationships of two people who love each other and choose to marry regardless of their gender. That is what a modern Australia looks like to some of my fellow- students- and I. And she co-signed it with other Merici College students. I have spoken at other schools in my electorate. Often I will get asked about marriage equality. Indeed, it's probably the most common question to come up in school forums. Often, before answering the question, I will ask them to put up their hands for those who support or don't support marriage equality. I see in ACT schools, including the local Catholic schools, overwhelming support for marriage equality. For generation Y and generation Z, this is a no-brainer. This is simply an extension of equality. My eldest son, Sebastian, 10 years old, said to me the other day that he just couldn't understand why we hadn't gotten marriage equality done. I have to say that I didn't have a very good answer for him. In conclusion, I want to acknowledge those who've worked so hard to make this a reality-long-time campaigners such as Rodney Croome, Australian Marriage Equality's Tim Gartrell, Patrick Batchelor, Ashley Hogan, Joseph Scales, Georgia Kriz, Audrey Marsh, the extraordinary Jacob White, Nita Green, Wil Stracke, Emmanuel Cusack, Pat Honan, Donald Rhodes, Adam Knobel and Anda Mednis.  Here in Canberra I want to acknowledge UnionsACT, particularly Moira Cully; the CPSU, particularly Amy Knox; and the CFMEU and many other unions, including United Voice. Within our Labor family, I want to acknowledge Rainbow Labor and those within ACT Labor, particularly Pat Connell, James Koval, Matt Byrne and others in the party office. Of course, I want to acknowledge the unsurpassable Andrew Barr and the ACT government; Travis Jordan; at the Australian National University, the ANU Queer* Department, particularly Matthew Mottola; and ANU and University of Canberra students, particularly Hamish McLennan, Robert Baillieu and Hugo Ottesen. I want to acknowledge the local businesses that have hosted parties, donated venues, goods and services and put placards of support in their windows. I want to acknowledge local organisations A Gender Agenda; the AIDS Action Council of the ACT; ACT Parents, Family and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, especially Dianne Hinton; Diversity ACT; and the P&amp;Cs of schools in Fenner, and the local school students who have petitioned and met with me over recent years.  It's been a national campaign. I recognise the Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby, Wear it Purple, Rainbow Families and individuals such as Ivan Hinton-Teoh, and Tiernan Brady, who jumped on a plane shortly after making marriage equality a reality in Ireland and has helped to achieve the same outcome here. Tiernan, you should be pretty damn proud of yourself. I want to acknowledge the ACT citizen volunteers who stepped up to this campaign and, of course, the parliamentarians who have been there campaigning for equality for LGBTIQ rights for years-people such as Tanya Plibersek; Anthony Albanese; Senator Penny Wong; Senator Louise Pratt; our leader, Bill Shorten; and Stephen Jones, who in 2012 moved the first marriage equality motion in this House. I spoke in favour of it but unfortunately missed the vote because my third son, Zachary, was born on that very day of the vote, 19 September 2012. I assure marriage equality advocates that I did check beforehand whether it was going to come down to one vote. Having been assured it would not, I was at my wife's side for our child's birth. I acknowledge too Senators Janet Rice and Dean Smith for their hard work in the other place. Finally, I want to address the concern about religious protections. I want to point out proposed section 47(3) in the bill. As the shadow Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, has noted, there are clear protections in place. Proposed section 47(3) reads:  (3) To avoid doubt, a minister of religion may refuse to solemnise a marriage, despite anything in this Part or any law of a State or Territory, if any of the following applies: (a) the refusal is consistent with the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the religion of the minister's religious body or religious organisation; (b) the refusal is made because of the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion; (c) the minister's genuine religious or conscientious beliefs do not allow the minister to solemnise the marriage. The bill does not need to be amended. It needs to be passed. We need to make marriage equality a reality at long last."
48943,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Michael Sukkar,1,LP,Deakin,2,"It is quite a significant occasion today to get up to speak on this Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. Clearly, the public vote endorsed a change to the definition of 'marriage', and there's no doubt that this parliament-there was no doubt in the Senate and certainly there is no doubt in the House of Representatives-will endorse the will of the people. It's no secret that I haven't been a supporter of same-sex marriage. Nevertheless, I won't be opposing this bill, notwithstanding its very deep flaws, because I respect the verdict of the Australian people as expressed in the postal plebiscite. And wasn't the plebiscite a great success? With nearly 80 percent of eligible Australians voting, we have been absolutely vindicated in wanting to give them a say. It's quite shameful that so many individuals fought tooth and nail to deny Australians a direct say on this very significant social change. I suspect that, like so many of the elites on the left, they didn't believe that the Australian people could be entrusted with a decision such as this. We now hear the flowery words of everyone around the chamber about the quite resounding 'yes' result being a good thing. They are the same people who used every tactic and did everything in their power-indeed, they even took the postal plebiscite to the High Court, where they were unceremoniously turfed out-to try and deny the Australian people a say in the postal plebiscite.  I give particular credit, firstly, to former Prime Minister Abbott, who was the Prime Minister at the time when a determination of the coalition party room said that the Australian people, for a significant social change such as this, should get a say and should be the final arbiters of that decision. I also give great credit to Prime Minister Turnbull, who, in the face of a very unprincipled Leader of the Opposition, stood firm, took a commitment to the election, was endorsed by the Australian people, stared the opposition leader down and got it done. So I give great credit to Prime Minister Turnbull for everything he did to empower the Australian people to have their say. And they did, and they overwhelmingly endorsed a change to the Marriage Act to include same-sex couples.  Having said that, almost five million Australians voted no, and their voices also need to be heard in this chamber. We cannot have a political culture, in any way, shape or form, of winner takes all. Their views must also be respected. Whilst, on one hand, there's absolutely no question that the Marriage Act should be amended to allow same-sex couples to marry, the wishes and the views of those five million Australians, to the extent that they can simultaneously be respected, must be respected. In that sense, this chamber is here to represent 100 percent of Australians, not the 60 percent who voted yes and certainly not the minority of 40 percent who voted no. To the extent that it's possible, we have to respect and represent all of those people. The Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill, which we are speaking about today, acquits, quite rightly, our responsibility and obligation to change the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples to marry. Sadly, it falls hopelessly short of providing religious freedoms, freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of thought and parental rights-the sorts of freedoms, quite frankly, that were promised to the Australian people throughout the postal plebiscite process.  I take my hat off to and congratulate those in the 'yes' campaign who successfully argued, and convinced many millions of Australians who voted yes, that 'of course' religious freedoms, freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, parental rights and thoughts would be protected. I think there are many millions of Australians who took them at their word when they said, 'No, this is just about allowing same-sex marriage couples to be married. There are no other consequences.' For that reason, I foreshadow that once the second reading stage concludes and we move into consideration stage I will be moving an amendment to further strengthen the religious freedoms in the bill. I will also be supporting a range of other amendments that I'm aware will be moved by my colleagues to acquit our obligation to represent all Australians where it doesn't conflict with what we're fundamentally doing in this bill, changing the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples to marry. Some have argued that no further amendments are necessary, because doing so seeks to address problems that don't exist. Sadly, these are the same people who, when arguing against the postal plebiscite in February last year, said that we shouldn't do it, because it would unleash a torrent of harassment and abuse towards gay and lesbian Australians. I suspect some of them sincerely felt that, but I suspect others used that as an excuse not to support the pathway to where we have arrived today.  Sadly, as many members have noted in this House, it turned out that most of that harassment and abuse came from some very extreme elements of the 'yes' case. I had no doubt during the campaign that decent, honest, well-meaning 'yes' voters would have cringed at half of those events where 'no' voters in particular were treated extraordinarily badly, but that does show there is a sizeable group that don't have tolerance for any other views and certainly don't have tolerance for the five million Australians who voted no. Some of these events included white powder being sent to the 'no' campaign offices; an attempted car bombing; death threats; activists harassing almost every 'vote no' event; threatening behaviour, in a couple of cases jumping on the stage at 'no' campaign events; calling for the death of 'no' voters; and, of course, the high-profile case of a 'no' voting teenager being sacked when she expressed her view on social media. These are the examples that found their way into the media. I suspect there were countless others where an absolute intolerance was shown by, I think, a minority of those who were purporting to be 'yes' voters. They were a small minority, but a very damaging minority nonetheless. That's why this bill must do everything it can to acquit the promises that so many people in this chamber made that there would be no further consequences for religious freedoms, freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of thought and parental rights.  In coming to this debate-a really significant debate in the time that I've been in this parliament-I had a look at my maiden speech and reflected on it. In that speech I spoke about the two greatest influences on my life-my family and my faith. It is clear to me that these two influences, for me personally, have also been the two influences that have had the most profound impact on our society. I think few can deny that. As an Australian of Lebanese descent, and a Maronite Catholic, I think I have greater insights into the hesitance of so many ethnic communities in supporting a change to the definition of marriage. As we saw from the results throughout the country-and I don't think it is controversial to say this-areas with a high proportion of people either born overseas themselves or with a parent or two parents born overseas overwhelmingly had a much lower 'yes' vote. A range of electorates, particularly throughout Western Sydney, had a very significant 'no' vote. The electorate of Blaxland, for example, had a 'no' vote in the 1970s. In reflecting on my faith and reflecting on my heritage as a first-generation Australian, I came across a very important quote from the Maronite bishop Antoine-Charbel Tarabay, who is the leader of my church. He said it more eloquently than me when he said the following: 'For us Maronites, our faith is more than just a set of beliefs. It is a way of life and a constant reminder of the persecution and hardships that our forefathers had to endure to preserve this faith and to pass it on to us. We hope and pray that Australia, this generous nation that has welcomed millions and millions of migrants, will continue to respect and protect the religious freedoms of all people.' That absolutely summed up, I think, the feelings of so many Australians in this debate, and I think it sums it up for them regardless of their faith, whether that be a Christian faith, Hindu, Sikh, Islamic, Buddhist or other. But so many of those communities have witnessed, seen firsthand, experienced and, in many cases, suffered the bitter consequences of religious intolerance and persecution. That is why so many of them today are absolutely begging that this House absolutely acquits our responsibility to conform to the overwhelming wishes of the Australian people and change the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples to marry, but that, importantly, we live up to the commitments of so many and provide absolutely stringent religious freedoms-freedom of speech; freedom of thought; freedom of conscience-and protections for those who subscribe to a traditional view of marriage.  We've seen in so many jurisdictions around the world who draw on the same bodies of law that we do-the same international obligations on discrimination, antidiscrimination laws and human rights laws-that those who hold a traditional view of marriage suffer disadvantage in their society in a post-same-sex-marriage world. I don't think anyone in this chamber wants to see that. So, even if you think it's unnecessary, for the avoidance of doubt, I would be urging everyone in this chamber to support the amendment that I will move, and the amendments that I know many of my colleagues will move, to strengthen the freedoms in this bill. None of them are to provide any ability for discrimination against gay and lesbian Australians; they are just protections that provide those who hold a traditional view of marriage the comfort that they will not be harangued, harassed, or in some other way suffer a financial or legal disadvantage by holding on to their traditional views of marriage, because, as Bishop Tarabay said, for so many Australians, including me, these are deep-seated values. These are values and freedoms that brought so many communities to our country to start with. And, as Liberals and Nationals particularly, if we don't protect those freedoms, who will? "
48944,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Pat Conroy,1,ALP,Shortland,3,"I am so relieved that, hopefully, by the end of this week we will have marriage equality in this country. It's with pride that I stand to make a contribution to the debate on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. I'm proud that almost 68 percent of Shortland electors who participated in the survey voted for marriage equality. The people of Shortland have overwhelmingly endorsed marriage equality. In fact, 62,455 Australians in Shortland voted yes. Our community participated and voted in favour of marriage equality well above the New South Wales and Australian averages.  This was a fabulous result, but it was an unnecessary result. Let us be clear: this non-binding postal survey was unnecessary, damaging and a waste of taxpayers' money. The government wasted $100 million outsourcing parliament's job. This policy of the survey was driven by the majority of the coalition party room's desire to oppose marriage equality-to delay, to obfuscate and to avoid doing their moral duty of debating an important issue. We just heard the contribution from the member for Deakin, which I won't reflect on other than to say that we didn't have a plebiscite when the Marriage Act was changed 20 times previously to this. We didn't have a plebiscite when no-fault divorce was introduced into this country. We did haven't a plebiscite when IVF was debated, when RU 486 was debated or when the state parliaments debated decriminalising homosexuality. Not a single one of those required a plebiscite or a non-binding postal survey, yet they were undeniably issues of fundamental morality equal to what we're debating now. That proves that this entire thing was a sham to paper over the cracks in the coalition party room, and the Prime Minister now claiming that this process was a triumph is disappointing and quite pathetic. I don't seek to be overly partisan in my contribution. I want to acknowledge and praise the courage and principle of the members for Leichhardt, Brisbane, North Sydney and Goldstein and Senator Dean Smith, who have been courageous, brave and principled in their approach. However, the Prime Minister's speech demonstrated a complete unawareness of the hurt that this survey has caused. The National LGBTI Health Alliance report presented a sobering reminder of the negative impact the postal survey had on already vulnerable groups of Australians. The report revealed that almost 80 percent of LGBTI Australians and almost 60 percent of supporters said they'd found the marriage equality debate considerably or extremely stressful. LGBTI Australian respondents' depression, anxiety and stress increased by more than one-third after the announcement of the vote, compared to the six months before the announcement. In addition, LGBTIQ phone counselling service QLife recorded a more than 20 percent increase in the number of calls during the survey period. This is the legacy of the non-binding postal survey.  But we are where we are now. This debate fundamentally is about discrimination. Anytime we fight and eradicate discrimination for one group, we enrich everyone. We make society a better place. I'm principally descended from Irish Catholics. As such, I'm acutely aware of entrenched discrimination. I'm acutely aware of the use of the state through both legal and informal means to entrench discrimination. The current definition of 'marriage' is discriminatory. It prohibits an entire group of our fellow Australians from making a decision to marry their partner that, currently, heterosexual Australians are free to make. In the case of the institution of marriage, LGBTI Australians do not enjoy access to the same rights and privileges that heterosexual Australians do. It is a fundamental right. Surely, people who want to commit to spending their life together, to loving and looking after each other and maybe having a family as well, will greatly strengthen the fabric of our society? The proudest day of my life, besides the birth of my two kids, was when I got married to my wife. This feeling is probably one of the most common amongst human beings, and it's a feeling that should not be denied to LGBTI Australians. That's why I was a consistent advocate for marriage equality prior to being elected in 2013. I've always been very open with constituents and anyone who's inquired that, if this issue gets debated in parliament, I will be voting yes.  Regarding the foreshadowed amendments to protect so-called religious freedoms, I say this to those who want to move those amendments: this bill is not about Safe Schools, this bill is not about telling parents what they can teach their children and this bill does not compel churches to change their views or the way they preach their views. This bill is an instrument to simply remove discriminatory clauses in the Marriage Act. It does nothing more than that. It contains adequate protections for religious organisations. It creates a new class of religious celebrants, which I must state I am uncomfortable with. If I were writing the legislation, I wouldn't include that, but I understand the importance of that to people and, as such, I will support it.  But I will not support any measure that weakens our discrimination laws. I will not support any attempt to allow commercial vendors to discriminate against one group of Australians. This push is no different to bars banning Indigenous customers. This push is no different from employers refusing to employ Catholics, and that is why I am opposed to the amendments. I am opposed to anything that weakens the discrimination laws in this country. In the time remaining, I want to reflect on how Labor has arrived at our position. It is a history that is very mixed. I am not seeking to be triumphant or to claim that Labor is the only political organisation to fight discrimination. However, I do want to point out the following: it was a Labor government that first decriminalised homosexuality. Of the seven states and territories that decriminalised homosexuality through legislation, five were Labor governments. The Keating government took significant steps around LGBTI rights, and I am proud that the Rudd government removed discrimination against same-sex couples from 85 federal laws. In 2012, the Labor member for Whitlam, Stephen Jones, introduced a marriage equality bill, and Labor allowed a conscience vote for its members. However, it failed due to the coalition binding its members. So I will not be lectured to by the coalition, that somehow they are the reason we are having marriage equality in this country. This is a history I'm proud of. However, we should not skate over the bigotry and the prioritisation of political self-interest that was the approach of some in the Labor Party. It is a disgrace that it took until 2011 for Labor's official platform to support marriage equality.  I want to acknowledge and thank the many Labor activists who fought for marriage equality both within and without the party for decades. These include, but are not limited to: Senator Penny Wong, the member for Grayndler, the member for Griffith, the member for Whitlam, the member for Sydney, Senator Louise Pratt, Penny Sharpe MLC and former senator John Faulkner. I apologise to anyone who I missed on that list. I want to thank and applaud all members of Rainbow Labor, including founding convener, Ryan Heath, who I had the privilege of working with in a past life. In particular, I want to say to Penny and Albo: thank you for your courage, dedication and determination. I can say without any fear of contradiction that we would not be here without your valiant effort over decades. It was a valiant effort aimed at ending discrimination on the simple premise that discrimination against one group of Australians-one group of humans, in fact-hurts and diminishes all humans. That's why this legislation is so important. By removing this discrimination, not only do we enrich the lives of LGBTI Australians, we enrich the lives of all Australians and enhance our society. Finally, I want to say to the LGBTI community: congratulations, but also thank you. Thank you for the determination, respect and positivity you have shown in campaigning for this issue. Thank you for beating down the barriers of oppression with your love for each other and for Australians everywhere. There is no doubt in my mind that through this fight you have made Australia a better place now and into the future. I commend the bill to the House. "
48945,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Michael McCormack,1,Nats,Riverina,4,"I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. In the Riverina electorate, 47,333-54.6 percent-returned a 'yes' response to the Australian marriage law postal survey. For the 'no' response, 39,308-or 45.4 percent of people-indicated they wanted the law to remain unchanged. There were 86,641-77 percent-eligible people in the Riverina electorate who participated in the survey. There was a strong participation rate across age demographics, the strongest being the 70 to 79 years range, with 90.4 percent; then 65 to 69 years, with 88 percent; and 80 to 84 years, with 87.7 percent of eligible voters. I have received hundreds of letters from my constituents across the Riverina and central west expressing strong views on both sides of the debate. It is encouraging to see such a strong participation rate from the Riverina, with people clearly taking the opportunity to make their voice heard.  The result is clear, and I will respect the majority view of the Riverina electorate and vote in support of this bill. Right from the time that we agreed as a joint party room of Liberals and Nationals, and the then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott, the member for Warringah, declared that we would be going down the plebiscite path, I said that I would uphold the will of the Australian people. This caused some consternation in my electorate, particularly with my local newspaper, when it became obvious that electorate-by-electorate results would be determined, and that I was going to support the will of the Australian people. It was enunciated that I had backflipped. I had not. I think if the parliament were to go to the trouble, the time, the effort and, indeed, the expense of asking the Australian people what they want, and then if I were to turn around and reject that view if the Australian people wanted a change on a particular matter, then that would not be democracy at work. Despite what the Riverina decided or did not decide, I was always going to uphold the will of the people. I made that quite clear. I made it clear in a national press conference well before my local print media asked me, despite the fact that I had given some television interviews on it locally. To not uphold the will of the people would not be democracy at work. I've made that point quite clear. The Australian people have spoken, and they actually appreciated the fact that they were asked for their view. I would have been quite happy to vote on it on the floor of the House. I said so in the joint party room. I made it publicly clear that I would have been happy to have a vote in the parliament.  I will just take a couple of moments-though I don't want to get into a partisan argument-to note that the previous speaker, the member for Shortland, said that he didn't want to overpoliticise this, and then went on to say that this postal marriage survey was papering over the cracks in the coalition party room and that we were pathetic. I just want to point out: had Labor taken a party view on this and had some members of the Labor Party been opposed to it, they would have been expelled from their party. They are the Labor rules. If you go against or vote against the Labor view or a position taken by the party, you are expelled from the party. That position is not held by the coalition; I have voted against my party and voted against the coalition on water legislation. That is why this bill did not come before the parliament for six years.  It is the coalition that has brought this bill and brought about this result for the Australian people and for those people who wanted a change to the Marriage Act. It has been brought about by the Australian people, by the Liberals and Nationals giving the Australian people a say in it. Australians have clearly embraced the opportunity to have their say as part of the process, with 79 percent-or 12,727,920-of eligible Australians participating and having their vote counted. Of those, 61.6 percent-or 7,817,247-responded yes, and 4,873,987-or 38.4 percent-responded no.  As the minister responsible for the Australian Bureau of Statistics, I'd like to acknowledge the role that that august organisation played in this marriage law postal survey. It has been a significant past year for the ABS. The 2016 census delivered the high-quality data that Australia needs to make informed decisions on important policy matters. The Australian public showed strong support for the census, with a response rate of 95.1 percent. Just like the census, we've seen strong participation and response to the marriage law survey. This is not just because Australians wanted to have their say but because Australians believe in and respect the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I say that despite the fact that the census was much maligned; it is now used by a lot of demographers, not least of whom is Bernard Salt, and others at newspapers for a lot of their material and copy because it was a good census. The marriage law survey has been a significant logistical undertaking, exceptionally well delivered by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I'm glad that the member for Canberra is in the parliament to hear me say this, because I know that many of her constituents work for that very well-respected organisation, the ABS. An exercise of this scale-giving every eligible Australian on the electoral roll the opportunity to have their say and to implement the process to enable this within just a few months-is huge. It's a massive undertaking.  To the Australian Statistician, David Kalisch; his deputy, Johnathan Palmer; and all of the staff of the ABS: I commend their professionalism in the conduct and delivery of the marriage law survey. The ABS was also strongly supported, principally by the Australian Electoral Commission, Australia Post, the Department of Human Services and the Department of Finance. Thank you to all of those public service teams involved in the process. I'm sure the member for Canberra acknowledges that as well.She's nodding-so thank you, Member for Canberra. They've done a great job. I'd also urge some caution in this debate. We do not need to de-gender society. We do not need to defund charities and organisations which have long-held traditional views. I also want to make some remarks about some newspaper editorials that I wrote nearly a quarter of a century ago which I should not have. This was against the backdrop of a society and a federal government fraught with fear about the spread of AIDS. There were Grim Reaper media advertisements which really had an impact. They took their toll. That said, my words were unwise. Words hurt, and hurt lasts. I said sorry then. I've apologised many times since. I do so in the federal parliament again today. Many constituents have also sent me emails prior to and since the survey, and I'll just read few of them. They show the difference of opinion, but they also show passionate people wanting to have their view heard. 'Your electorate has spoken. It is time for you to do your job and for Australia to have marriage equality,' wrote a constituent via email on 15 November, the day the decision was announced. 'I urge you and your colleagues to expedite and support the legislation that will effect this change and to pursue the social change that has clearly been endorsed by Australia.' Another one was: 'I do sincerely ask you to consider the rights of all Australians to the fundamental freedoms of thought, conscience, religion and belief, expression of opinion, assembly and association when considering the terms of any draft bill to ensure it protects these freedoms of those with a genuine belief that marriage is the union of a man and a woman.' I voted no-I want to make that point clear-but respect those who did not have the same view and voted yes. This is a final one I'll put on Hansard: 'If same-sex marriage is going to come to pass, please do what you can to ensure that the appropriation protections are in place. While I understand that parliamentarians will feel morally bound to pass legislation to change the definition of marriage, the legislation should have attached to it strong protections for freedom of speech and conscience and parental rights to raise their children with the understanding that marriage is only between a man and a woman.'  Whilst acknowledging the provisions are already in place, I encourage amendments with genuine protections for religious freedoms, freedom of speech and parental choice. I recognise and say that discrimination cannot and will not be tolerated in any way, shape or form. To the LGBTIQ community and those of the same gender who wish to get married: good luck to you, may you enjoy all the freedoms that have been enjoyed in the past by heterosexual couples, and may your futures together be loving ones."
48946,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Gai Brodtmann,0,ALP,Canberra,1,"As I did in 2012, today I proudly rise in support of marriage equality. But today I do so for different reasons. Five years ago I was convinced the argument was all about justice, that all should be equal before the law. But in those five years I've had hundreds of conversations with the LGBTIQ community, their families and their friends, and what has become apparent to me is that, yes, this is about equality and, yes, this is about justice, but, most importantly, it is about love: the right of all Australians to love who they want.  At the time of former President Obama's birth, in 1962, his parents could not have been legally married in 16 states of the country he governed, because his father was black and his mother was white. Three years before he was born, a trial judge in Virginia sentenced an interracial husband and wife to one year's jail, with the words: Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, Malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages.  In 1967, the US Supreme Court would unanimously overturn that ruling in a famous civil rights case. There was a deep irony in the surname of the couple that brought the case: Mildred and Richard Loving. In Loving v Virginia, the Supreme Court ruled: Marriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' ... In an interview, the famous conservative US lawyer Ted Olson recalled this case. He said that in preparation for it, a lawyer asked Richard Loving, 'What shall I tell the justices of the Supreme Court?' And he said, 'Tell them I love my wife.' That's what this is all about: love. The Australian people have delivered a strong statement about equality, about justice and about love by voting in favour of legalising same-sex marriage in Australia. I'm delighted and proud that the ACT recorded the highest percentage of 'yes' votes of any state or territory in Australia, with 74 percent. I'm particularly delighted and very proud that my own electorate had the highest percentage of 'yes' voters in the ACT, with 74.1 percent, and also the highest turnout in the ACT, at 83.2 percent. That said, I do acknowledge that there are members of my community who did not vote yes, and I respect that. During this survey and over the course of my time as member for Canberra, I have always underscored the need for respect and tolerance. Deputy Speaker, in October 2013, the ACT Legislative Assembly legalised marriage equality, becoming the first jurisdiction in Australia to allow same-sex couples to marry under law. A few weeks later, the decision made in the assembly was overturned. Couples silently sobbed as the High Court ruled that the ACT law was inconsistent with federal marriage legislation. The Canberra Times reported that as couples left the courtroom that day they were heard saying to each other, 'It's not over.' They were right, and nearly four years later we are here, hopefully, ensuring that it is actually and finally over.  I congratulate the LGBTIQ community and their families and friends for their commitment and persistence over many years and decades and through the course of this survey, which has been deeply confronting. Imagine that an entire nation has stood in judgement of your relationships, of your character, of your morality, of your worth and of your love. LGBTIQ parents have been scared witless about the toll that this was going to take on their children, as the nation stood in judgement of them as parents-of their right to be parents and of their ability as parents. I bitterly resent this and I take deep offence at it, because I was raised by a single mother. I bitterly resent and take deep offence at the 'fact' that after being raised by a single mother I am somehow damaged or dysfunctional. We know that families come in many forms. Over the ages, children have been raised by aunts, uncles, grandparents, siblings, cousins, friends, benefactors, the church, the court, nannies and boarding schools. What is critical is that children in all circumstances are loved, respected, nurtured and safe. This is the case for children raised by single mothers-as I was-and children raised by LGBTIQ mothers and fathers.  On the day of the results of the marriage equality survey, there was a lot of nervous energy here in Canberra as people gathered in workplaces and around the city to hear and watch the outcome. A week earlier, we had the race that stopped the nation, and this was a survey, as we know, that stopped the nation. Across the ACT, you could hear a collective intake of breath as the results were read out. The images of before and after the result showed the amazing weight lifting off the shoulders of, particularly, the LGBTIQ community, their families, their friends, and supporters of marriage equality. It was a weight that had been bearing down on some of them for decades. In Lonsdale Street, in my electorate, there was a block party where Canberrans came together to celebrate the result. It was a celebration that was spontaneous and exuberant. Thousands flocked to the party. Couples embraced each other. Children armed with chalk created a rainbow that went right across the street. They were so proud and so happy that long-awaited change had finally come-in the form of a survey, anyway. It was in the form of the affirmation of the nation. They were so proud and so happy that our nation had affirmed its commitment to those qualities that are part of our social fabric and DNA here in Australia: fairness and equality. Next week, I celebrate my 20th wedding anniversary on 13 December. My marriage is the most important thing in my life. I'm very much looking forward to celebrating that significant date with my husband even though, unfortunately, he's not going to be with me on the night. My husband is my best friend. He's my greatest supporter. He is the love of my life. I cannot imagine what my life would be without him. Our marriage has enriched my life, and I'd like to think that it has enriched his life. It has enriched my life in untold ways. I want every Australian to experience the enrichment that you can get from a successful marriage-and I do classify mine as a successful marriage. Here we are, nearly 20 years on-20 years; who would have thought?-from that day that we first struck our union.  Thank you. In closing, I want to commend and thank ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr and Canberrans Tom Snow, Stephen Byron, Terry Snow, the Snow family, the Byron family and Claire Dawson for their leadership on this issue. No-one arriving at Canberra Airport or driving across Kings Avenue or Commonwealth Avenue bridges could be left in any doubt about Canberra's views on marriage equality. I also want to commend and thank the thousands and thousands of Labor members and Rainbow Labor who've campaigned on this issue over the course of this year, over the course of the last decade and over the course of decades. I want to commend and thank the hundreds of Canberrans who came up to me in the streets, at mobile offices and at coffee catch-ups to express their support. Here, I want to particularly acknowledge those Canberrans who are over 70, because a lot of attention has been rightly focused on the fact that we had such a huge response to this survey from so many young Australians but what has really struck me is the fact that there have been so many older Canberrans-particularly over 70-who have been strong advocates and strong campaigners on this issue. They've approached me for 'yes' badges, stickers and posters in bulk for their children and grandchildren. I want to commend and thank Senator Dean Smith for his courage in drafting and putting forward this bill, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. It has required considerable resilience and bravery-the sort of resilience and bravery that so many have shown over decades-and, for that, he needs to be acknowledged. Thousands and thousands of Australians also need to be acknowledged. They are those thousands and thousands of Australians who've been victims of hate crimes, vilification, discrimination and ridicule. They are those thousands and thousands of Australians who've been shunned, shamed and estranged from family and friends in country towns and metropolitan cities. Those thousands and thousands of Australians who've led secret lives or entered into marriages or relationships that did not reflect who they were, who they are. Those thousands and thousands of Australians who've been denied the most basic of human rights-the most basic of human rights-to be themselves.  I also want to acknowledge my friends who've tirelessly fought the good fight for equality-friends who are now in their 50s and their 60s who have suffered unspeakable discrimination since their teens. I want to acknowledge my friends who are no longer with us, who died in their 20s, in the dreadful, dark, frightening early days of AIDS in Australia in the eighties. And I want to acknowledge one friend, who we discovered last week may not be with us at Christmas thanks to spinal cancer. His name is Chris Grady. Chris and I first met at the ACT Assembly in the very early days, when he was working with Terry Connolly. I really want to take this opportunity, Chris, to say how deeply moved we were to speak to you last week, and to say thanks for your friendship, thanks for your contribution to Canberra and thanks so much for the good times.  Now is the time to give Australia's LGBTIQ community the best present ever for Christmas: the opportunity to love and to celebrate that love in union before their families and before their friends. Because as Ted Olson said about half a century ago when he was challenging California's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, 'This fight shouldn't be considered a liberal issue or a conservative issue; it should be considered a matter of equal rights and equal dignity to individuals.' He said:  People are not, do not choose to be gay. They are born with characteristics that cause their sexual orientation to be what it is. They deserve happiness and equality and dignity and respect and absence of discrimination in their lives the same as the rest of us do. In 2012, 42 of us voted in this chamber for LGBTIQ Australians to live the same as the rest of us do. Only 23 of us are still here today. This week, I look forward to the majority of this chamber joining with we 23 from 2012 to realise the sentiments of Ted Olson more than 50 years ago, and make marriage equality a reality. "
48947,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Andrew Gee,1,Nats,Calare,4,"I support the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. This parliament passes legislation on almost every day that it sits. Some bills are forged into laws in the fiery furnace of partisan politics. Most legislation passes without much debate, controversy or fanfare. But this bill is neither of those; nevertheless, it will be long remembered.  It comes to this place after consultation with the Australian public by way of a national postal survey. The ability to settle matters of national significance peacefully at the ballot box is a feature of our nation that we should all be justly proud of. The survey process that led to this bill being introduced to the House of Representatives this week saw a national participation rate of 79.5 percent. Australians were keen to be heard on this issue. In Calare, 78.1 percent of voters returned their forms. This high participation rate is important for two reasons. Firstly, it can't be argued that there isn't a national mandate for this change to how our society defines marriage. Secondly, no Australian of voting age can say that their voice wasn't heard. Nobody can say that their opinion wasn't counted. Every Australian got their say. That's democracy. As you would expect from a country electorate in the heartland of the nation, the debate in our part of the world was, for the most part, very respectful. In central-western New South Wales and around the nation, the result was clear and conclusive. In Calare, 54,091 people, or 60.2 percent, voted in favour of changing the definition of marriage, and 35,779 people, or 39.8 percent, voted against. These figures were very close to the national result. As those figures also highlight, there are significant numbers of people on either side of this issue.  With the nation having delivered its verdict, the will of the Australian people now needs to be passed into law, and that responsibility falls to us. This is the moment for the Australian people to see their parliament at its best. I followed the passage of this legislation through the Senate and I was impressed with the respectful and constructive manner in which the debate was conducted. I'm confident that the remainder of this debate will also be conducted in the best traditions of the communities we all represent. Some in our region may find this change in how marriage is defined difficult to accept and reconcile. It is a significant change, but I ask those people to try to accept it because now is the time for the nation to come together. We should unite across city communities and country communities. Everyone, no matter how they voted, across Calare and across Australia, should now unify. There are same-sex couples currently waiting to get married in the Calare electorate. They should now have that opportunity, without delay or bitterness, and they should be treated with respect and dignity by all-and I know that, in Calare, they will be.  Before the last general election, I undertook to respect the will of the Calare electorate on this issue. I said it and I meant it. I honour that commitment today. To those same-sex couples in Calare waiting to be married, to their families and friends and to those same-sex couples in Calare who may marry in the future: you have my congratulations and best wishes and those of the electorate. Above all, we wish you happiness in the years ahead. I cast my vote in favour of this legislation for you."
48948,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Ed Husic,1,ALP,Chifley,2,"It is a great honour to speak in a debate-the debate on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017-that will make such a big difference in the lives of many. Parliaments are sometimes confronted by serious decisions that need to be made on behalf of the nation-decisions made ahead of time or far from a position that some in the general public are comfortable to hold. What is clear to many of us is that many in the Australian public have been well ahead of their parliamentarians. This has become blazingly evident in the last few weeks, where the nation, with a strong voice, indicated it wants the parliament to remove discriminatory legal barriers set within the Marriage Act.  I'm a parliamentarian who will lend my support to this push. I have been up-front about this since I announced in May 2015 that I would support marriage equality. But that statement itself admits that I was not always a supporter of that effort-and I wasn't. When the matter was considered in 2012, I voted against it. I argued then that, in the electorate that I represent, I could not detect the will to change the Marriage Act. The outcome of the recent marriage postal survey for the Chifley electorate demonstrates that my reading of the local mood was right, with a majority of residents opposed to altering the Marriage Act. While my reading of the mood of my fellow residents was right, my actions in opposing this reform were not. I would like to explain that reasoning in a moment, particularly as it applies to the way I intend to vote on this bill. But let me first reflect on my position back in 2012. Back then, I maintained a position that I didn't detect a mood for change. However, people from my electorate wanting to see that change and disappointed in my position would say that, while others may not have a sense of urgency for change, change meant a great deal to them. Constituents would ask me, as their representative, 'Why can't you support us in the things we want to do in our lives?' These situations made me think deeply about this issue. If there is no logical reason to prevent this change, why stand in the way of it?  I also reflect on this: as a country, we have welcomed people from nearly every corner of the globe to become Australian citizens. Seven million people have made their home here since the Second World War. They looked different, spoke differently, ate different foods, thought differently, acted differently and might have come from countries where they couldn't do that and paid a high price for difference. Many Australians take great pride in the fact that our nation has become one of the most successful multicultural nations on the planet. This did not happen by accident. There were no magic ingredients. It was a typically Australian low-key straightforward commitment to the important principle of fairness-fairness that included. It is that commitment to inclusion that I reflect upon now. It was our understanding that if people committed to the nation and its laws, there was a place for them. We did not use our laws to divide; we used them to bind and unite. I approached the survey and this vote in the very same way, recognising that this is our generation's opportunity to make its down payment on that inclusive approach for the benefit of those that follow by including, not by using the law to exclude.  As I've reflected earlier, I represent an area that voted against change. I want to express my profound respect for the views expressed by my fellow residents, some of whom have approached me to ask how I could support change when the electorate I proudly represent has a different view. My decision is not taken in defiance or without regard to those views. But I submit this for the consideration of those that questioned the decision I intend to make: I believe strongly that parliamentarians should think carefully when they propose to legislate to discriminate, where we might use our special position as parliamentarians with our ability to cast laws in a way where we might impose the will of majorities on the way others live their lives. Remember, this act will not change the way others who have married live their lives. Nothing changes for them. There will also be no change in the way religious bodies express their beliefs about marriage and how it is formed. Again, nothing changes. But not voting for change stops others in the way they wish to live their lives. This comes to the heart of the view I have of my role in this place. In a place where we dedicate much of our energy to highlighting differences, I would hope that we can find strength in the common purpose of bringing people together and giving people the space to live their lives unburdened by stigma, free of the sting that comes from being excluded. That's not just how I live my life as a parliamentarian but is what I believe in deeply as a citizen-as an average person-as someone who has benefitted from the nation's generosity in allowing my family to settle and participate in its daily life. This nation has provided me with a humbling honour-the ability to stand in this very spot, where I now say I will play my part to ensure that y fellow Australians are included and that they can savour the feeling, just in the way that I have benefitted from it.  I could make a whole lot of points expressing views about the postal survey process. I prefer that we focus on the positive important change we are about to make in peoples' lives. I would ask those within government who make much of the postal survey process to remember this point: it is probably unlikely that their ears would have felt the sting or hurt felt or triggered by hearing comments made during the survey process. But that hurt was felt and it may well linger for some time. What we owed to those who relied upon positive change to the law was courage, that as parliamentarians we could make those legislative changes free of the process forced upon the nation.  In speaking of courage, I would like to reflect on the courage of others who have walked this path well before me, people like Senator Penny Wong and Senator Louise Pratt, and other colleagues of mine, like the member for Griffith, Terri Butler. Also, on the other side of the political fence, Senator Dean Smith, had to have the courage not just to admit he was wrong but to make a difference as a result of that. I also want to express my gratitude for the courage of another colleague of mine, the member for Whitlam. In days when it was hard to express that view and to translate that view into legislation brought to this place, he not only argued that process within this place but also outside, where he had to confront views which, if expressed today, would be staggering to consider, and the way in which they translated potentially as a threat to his position as a parliamentarian. He displayed exemplary courage, and I want to commend him for what he has done, as I said, in walking a path-treading that path-well before I did.  At any rate, we are here now. We should make the change that must be made. And we should ensure that our nation can earn its place as one of the world's most inclusive places."
48949,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Darren Chester,1,Nats,Gippsland,4,"The Australian people were asked a simple question in the postal ballot:  Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry? The Australian people have voted yes. The people of Gippsland have voted yes. And I also will be voting yes. The people have spoken in what was quite a remarkable celebration of our magnificent democracy and there is no need for me to delay the parliament any further. It is time to get this done. I want to thank the people of Gippsland for the respectful manner in which the vast majority of people participated in this debate. I'm proud to be their member in this place. I will be working respectfully to ensure that this is a moment that unites our region and unites our nation, rather than divides it. I conclude with a quote from Nelson Mandela: No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.  I thank the House."
48950,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Rebekha Sharkie,0,CA,Mayo,4,"This Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 is very simple. It is about two things. It is about love and equality, and I'm a champion of both. I have the great joy of being a happily married woman, and that is a right, a joy and a comfort that I do not believe should be denied to any adult. I know there have been some quite prescriptive views detailed in this chamber on what defines marriage. What I know about marriage is that it's about two people forsaking all others. It's about good times; it's about hard times and it's about forgiveness. It is intensely personal and it's about finding a person who loves you for your faults as much as your merits. And I know what it is not: it is not purely about the creation of children. To say that marriage is for the purpose of bearing children, that that's the primary focus of marriage, I believe diminishes marriage. I, and many other married couples, do not have biological children with my spouse. Our marriage is no less because of this fact. Marriage is entirely about the deep commitment two people have for each other and for that commitment to be recognised in law. It is about love, for love is love.  I want to read out in the chamber one of the most poignant love stories shared with me during this debate. I received, as all of us did, so many letters about long-lasting commitment during this process. But this one more than any other has drifted into my mind over and over again. Dawn Cohen, from New South Wales, has given me her permission to tell her and Robin's love story:  Dear Rebekha We have been engaged for 34 years. Robin's parents have died while we have been waiting for the wedding. My father is now 90. Please please do all you can to give us marriage equality by Christmas. Our love has been my deepest teacher and my greatest joy. We have been there for each other in sickness and health. We have been attacked for being gay, but not for one second has our love wavered. Nothing will separate us until death do us part. This woman who has loved me so deeply and for so long, that eyes closed she knows what I am feeling from the sound of my tread on the stairs. And cares. Who else could she possibly be, this sun around whom I revolve, this moon that revolves around me: my deepest beloved, my wife.  After 35 years, we have surely earned the certificate that heterosexual couples can get before they even start the course. Dawn and Robin, I am so sorry we have taken so long in this place to legislate, recognise and value your marriage. I am also sorry for the deeply hurtful comments that the LGBTIQ community had to hear and billboards that you had to see. It was unkind, it was untrue and it was unnecessary. I do hope, this week, we can in this place go some way to right those wrongs. While I believe the parliament should have legislated in relation to marriage equality without a plebiscite or a postal survey, I was heartened by the turnout and vote in Mayo. In my electorate, 88,608 people-that is, 83.8 percent of my constituents-returned their postal surveys. This was significantly above the average Australian response rate of 79.5 percent. I'm pleased to say that 64.7 percent responded in favour of marriage equality, above the national average of 61.6 percent. The participation in the postal survey mobilised many in my community to enrol to vote, and particularly young people to engage. The electorate of Mayo recorded a 573 percent increase in voter enrolments in August, including a 1,258 percent boost in the number of people enrolling for the first time. In total, we received 2,827 enrolments, of which 910 were first-timers, and, of those enrolling for the first time, the average age was 20 years. According to the Australian Electoral Commission, more than 98,000 people were added to the roll in August, of which 65,000 were electors aged 18 to 24 years. More than any other issue in the last decade or two, this issue has engaged young people to participate and, I believe, will ensure young people have a greater role in determining the issues that matter, the issues that are campaigned on at election time and who is elected to this place in the future. I, along with the significant majority of my constituents, supported this bill to amend the Marriage Act to allow all couples to marry. This bill will remove a major remaining impediment to antidiscrimination from Australian law, treating Australians the same regardless of their gender or their sexuality. I want to reassure religious Australians that this bill will not take away the religious freedoms enjoyed by Australians. The bill will allow religious ministers and current civil celebrants who register as religious celebrants the right to refuse to marry couples if it runs contrary to their religious beliefs. Separate to this legislation, parents will continue to have the right to opt out of any sex education provided in schools, should they so choose, and religious schools will continue to be able to teach views on marriage and sexual relations that accord with their religious beliefs. I believe the campaign by some opponents of marriage equality was false and misleading in relation to the Safe Schools program. Let me be clear: in order for the Safe Schools program to operate in a school, the parent body of the school must agree to the program and, further, each parent of a student in that school has the right to decide if their child participates in the program.  Few human rights are enshrined within the Australian Constitution, but I take heart from the fact that religious freedom is one of those. Section 116 of the Constitution requires that the Commonwealth not legislate in respect of religion. I quote section 116:  The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. I reassure all Australians that religious freedoms are and will continue to be safe in Australia. That is what the bill in its current form, as transmitted from the Senate, provides for, and I do not believe that any amendments to this bill should be made in this chamber. It is important to remember that, while we enshrine freedom of religion, we also need freedom from religion. We live in a secular society, and so it is important that those who do not follow a religion do not have their rights impinged by others either. I would also like to allay the fear of the 'no' voters with the words of New Zealand's former Prime Minister Bill English. Marriage equality has been legal in New Zealand since 2012, but the Hon. Bill English originally voted against marriage equality in the New Zealand parliament. In December last year he said: I'd probably vote differently now on the gay marriage issue. I don't think that gay marriage is a threat to anyone else's marriage.  Asked why he'd changed his view, he stated: Just seeing the impact it has had for couples and the fact that it doesn't erode marriage. So, this week, Australia will finally join Argentina, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United States, Uruguay, parts of Mexico, and the United Kingdom. We will have marriage equality, as we should. I'd like to finish with a quote from Maya Angelou: Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope. I wish every couple taking their vows following the passing of this legislation a long and happy marriage. Thank you."
48951,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Alex Hawke,1,LP,Mitchell,2,"Mr Deputy Speaker, 50.9 percent of the constituents in my electorate voted no to the question the government put in the postal survey on marriage. I want to say to the constituents of Mitchell that I'll be voting to respect the national outcome but also the majority of the people in Mitchell who voted no. I will not be opposing the passage of this bill, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, but instead will be seeking amendments-moving an amendment myself, and joining with colleagues to support other amendments-to secure what I regard as vital freedoms for religion, conscience and thought in Australia. It's true that Australia voted yes. But the views of the people of the electorate of Mitchell should not be ignored, and the views of people in Western Sydney also should not be ignored. As someone who was raised in Western Sydney and lived most of my life there, it's sad to me that the views of significant parts of Western Sydney are being completely unrepresented by their Labor Party representatives.  I want to step the House through some of the statistics that highlight and underscore this, because Western Sydney emphatically voted no in the postal marriage survey. You can start in my electorate, with just 51 percent voting no, but if you go to Greenway, 53.6 percent voted no, and to Parramatta, 61 percent voted no. You can go to Fowler, where 63.7 percent voted no, and 63.7 percent in Werriwa, 64 percent in McMahon and 69 percent in Watson, getting to 73 percent of people in Blaxland voting no. I was always a 'no' campaigner and advocate. I believe in a traditional view of marriage, and not because I think the state should deny same-sex couples the ability to form unions that are equivalent to marriage. Absolutely we should allow and provide for that, and now we will in this bill. But I was a 'no' advocate because I believe in the traditional view of marriage. It's a view obviously held by almost three-quarters of people in Western Sydney. Yet there is not one 'no' advocate or campaigner among the Labor members of parliament coming from Western Sydney, and they're unrepresented in-  Mr Brendan O'Connor: What did your seat say?  Mr HAWKE: Well, I've said it several times. I've said it voted no as well-51 percent, if you were listening. So, in Western Sydney we had a 'no' vote. Again, it's disappointing that here today the Labor Party think that the views of five million Australians-five million people who voted no-should go unrepresented. I want to address that briefly today, because it is vital in a democracy that the rights of minorities are protected as much as the rights of the majority, and five million people voting no is a substantial minority. And look at what has happened over the past few years. I draw the attention of the House to the rank hypocrisy we've seen in this debate. I've been here for the last 10 years. Some of you opposite who are here right now have not. We have voted to deny same-sex marriage seven times in this House since I've been here-seven times in this chamber. When John Howard inserted the traditional definition of marriage, as being between a man and a woman, it was unanimously supported by every person in this chamber at that time. It was unanimously supported by every member of the Labor Party, every member of the Liberal Party and every member of the National Party. It wasn't that long ago. Since then, the House has voted to deny a vote on this more than seven times. Since then, we've had the Labor Party change its position so that it would not be possible to be a Labor member of parliament and hold a 'no' position on same-sex marriage-and, in a few years, you will not be allowed to be preselected in the Labor Party. The biggest and most shameful part of the debate is that we are not genuinely having a conscience vote in this parliament-not in the Senate and not in the House of Representatives. The Labor Party is not free to vote on religious freedom amendments. Members of the Labor Party are not free to exercise their conscience. I want to record for this House, without naming any individuals, that there are members of the Labor Party in this House and in the Senate today who do oppose same-sex marriage, who do have a different view, and who are concerned for religious freedom. They hold those concerns, yet they are not free to exercise their conscience. They exist, they are there-out of respect for them, I will not name them-but they are not free. That is not leadership from the Leader of the Opposition.  I want to praise Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull for the decision he's taken. It takes courage to allow your members a free vote when you know they disagree with you. There is courage in the Liberal and National parties because our leaders, the former Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister, allow us the freedom to exercise our conscience on these issues. The Labor Party, under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, denies a free vote, so we will not actually have a conscience vote in this parliament. It is to the shame and discredit of this parliament that a genuine conscience vote on an important question like this will not be conducted. It hasn't been conducted in the Senate. We know members of the Labor Party will be bound on these amendments that we are proposing-and I will speak to the amendments that may be foreshadowed shortly.  I believe it is a failure of parliamentary process when we can't have a conscience vote. I thank the Prime Minister for bringing forward also an additional process that will take stock of religious legislation in Australia, led by a former member of this place, Philip Ruddock, and an eminent persons panel. It will give us another layer of protection, given that the Labor Party will not allow their members to consider religious freedom amendments. The consideration of those amendments is vital to the construction of this bill. Rather than being so concerned with emotion-we have let our reason give way to our emotion in this debate-we should be concerned with the construction of the law. We should be concerned with the rights of individuals. We should be concerned with the rights of the minority. That is the role of legislators in this place. We should not allow reason to give way to emotion in this debate. We must apply reason to ensure that the rights of the five million who voted no are respected as much as the rights of the eight million who voted yes.  It is as Alexis de Tocqueville said in Democracy in America: if you have unchecked political power, it leads to the tyranny of the majority. The greatest danger that de Tocqueville saw was that public opinion would be become an all-powerful force and the majority could tyrannise unpopular minorities and marginalised individuals. It's one of the most powerful discussions of democracy that has ever been had. The concept of the tyranny of the majority is one that we must resist in this parliament. It is why members of the Liberal and National parties will bring forward amendments in this House, as they did in the Senate, to ensure that we have protections for religious freedom at the same time that we provide for same-sex marriage. It's what our reason must consider as we pass a law of this nature. To not allow a free vote, to not allow an exercise of conscience when we are having a conscience debate on religious freedoms, allows the Labor Party to be ruled by the tyranny of the majority.  The coalition respects religious freedoms. Liberal and National senators, along with some independent senators, voted to protect religious freedoms. I suspect that, when this vote comes to a head and the amendments are considered, it will be the Liberal and National members of the parliament who are on the side of protecting religious freedom and ensuring that we have those important protections by way of amendments to this bill. There is no doubt that this bill has not sufficiently addressed the matters of protection of religious freedom, freedom of conscience and freedom of thought. There is need for vital amendments to this bill. There is nothing wrong with considering those amendments in a free and open debate. I say to the Labor Party again: why won't you allow your members the freedom to consider, in good conscience, amendments to protect religious freedom in Australia? There are five million people who voted no. Most of those 'no' voters come from Labor electorates in Western Sydney. Why wouldn't we respect them and allow for a free debate on this important topic?  The coalition respects religious freedom. Individual coalition members will be moving amendments to respect religious freedoms. It's a triumph of politics over the whole process, which will not allow a genuine conscience debate on those amendments. I would say again to members that, when we pass laws, we take into account all of the things that the Australian people are telling us. In this postal survey, they very clearly told us that they have no problem with same-sex marriage in Australia. But in many surveys since then and before then, with the same rate of support for same-sex marriage, they have also said they are concerned with protecting religious freedom in Australia. It ought to be a fundamental concern for Australians and for members of this parliament. We hear so much from the Labor Party about the results of opinion polls-that people have supported same-sex marriage constantly for a long time-but they've also supported respect for religious freedoms at that rate for the same amount of time. It would be good to see Labor coming forward and genuinely entering into negotiation to ensure that those freedoms are protected while we legislate for this historic change in our society.  I have been a consistent supporter of traditional marriage and, in this respect, I intend to join with colleagues and move an amendment. I foreshadow that amendment, which I will speak to later in this debate. I believe these amendments will support and help preserve the vital freedoms of thought, speech, conscience and religion that we have in Australia. Whenever we pass laws of this nature, we must have these as primary concerns. Our reason must not give way to our emotion. Our role as a parliament is to find in this debate the balance of freedoms to ensure that one right does not override another right, and we must seek to prevent any abuse of rights as we change our society. We do not want to come back here in the years ahead and attempt to repair matters that we could prevent by the way of substantive amendments to this bill. We can now have same-sex marriage and we can also have important protections for religious freedom in Australia. The rights and the concerns of the five million Australians who voted no are just as important as the eight million people who voted yes. We can, and we should, engage our reason in this debate, not our emotion. We should not allow groupthink or collectivism in the Labor Party to prevent us from having a genuine conscience vote on important protections for freedom of thought, freedom of conscience and freedom of religion. We need to amend this bill. I'll make the case for the amendments when I speak to those amendments. But I say to the House that we should get this right now. We should legislate religious freedom and protections now, and we should not let reason give way to emotion. "
48952,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Anne Aly,0,ALP,Cowan,2,"Australia is known around the world as the land of the fair go; we're pretty famous for that. The responsibility of each parliamentarian and government is to extend that fair go to people and communities that were not offered it when we began our time in this place. I realise that I'm one of many in a very long line of speakers to lend their voice to this debate on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, and I must say I'm very proud to do so. For some of us it's been personal and for some of us it's been political. But, for all of us, it's significant. I feel honoured to be in this place at this point in history.  Though the process was shrouded by the politics of those opposite and the survey was unnecessary and hurtful and divisive-it was an utter failure of leadership by the Prime Minister, who put aside his duty of care over LGBTIQ citizens in Australia-the final vote for marriage equality was a significant victory for the fair go. The 'yes' vote is a victory for LGBTI Australians who have fought so long for their love and their commitment to be recognised as equal to any other. It's a victory for their children and families, who have shown incredible strength in the face of a divisive and often bitter battle. It's a victory for the allies, friends and supporters who spent months, years and decades fighting for this change to come. This 'yes' vote is a victory for Australia. It confirms what millions of Australians already knew: LGBTI Australians are equal, their love is equal, and recognising their love under law is fair. I now speak directly to the LGBTI community in my seat of Cowan: know that I stand here with you and for you. Your Cowan community overwhelmingly voted yes, and I'm proud to reflect that vote in our federal parliament. And if you are planning a wedding, I do like to dance and eat cake-sometimes at the same time! I was not elected to represent people of colour across Australia. Though many-especially some who write into my office-think otherwise, I am not a representative of the ethnic communities or of different religious groups. But when these survey results are being used as yet another in a long list of issues painting ethnic and migrant communities as 'the other', or somehow un-Australian, I won't stay silent. I won't stay silent while the hypocrisy of those like Andrew Bolt and Mark Latham is given a platform. The 'no' campaign spent a great deal of time and resources campaigning to areas of high migrant communities, only to use those results to say that ethnic and migrant communities are at odds with Australian values and the Australian way of life. It is hypocrisy of the highest order and does a great disservice to the diversity and complexity of Australia's ethnic and migrant communities. We are not homogeneous.  I'd like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to LGBTI people of colour across Australia-those who have had to suffer double discrimination in a society that is stacked against them. For those LGBTI people of colour, this journey has often been twice as long, with twice as many obstacles. But we stand here today with you and for you. I would also like to pay tribute to Democracy in Colour, an organisation devoted to mobilising ethnic and migrant communities for progressive causes. These campaigners have been on the front lines of the marriage equality debate, and I thank them for their work.  I said in my first speech in this place: ... we should not allow important discussions about our future to degenerate into a competitive agenda of rights, for all rights are worth pursuing and worth pursuing with vigour. I stand by those words today. I firmly believe in the freedom of religion and belief. I firmly believe that the freedom of religion and belief is no less and no more important than the freedom to live without discrimination. But I do not accept that the freedom of religion and belief extends to the manifestation of that religion or belief when it infringes on the rights of others to live free from discrimination. We cannot, and must not, accept the winding back of antidiscrimination laws that have served our society so well for decades. We cannot remove one layer of discrimination and simply add, or replace it with, another. We cannot allow our LGBTI friends, family members, colleagues and comrades to be turned away at the bakery, the florist or the supermarket just because of who they love. That's not the Australia I know. The fact that we are having this discussion at all underscores that, though we rightly celebrate an overwhelming victory for the LGBTI community, we know this is not the final frontier to fairness for LGBTI Australians. Whether we look at health and mental health services, bullying in schools, discrimination in our laws, harassment on the street or the stacked disadvantage facing the trans community and LGBTI people of colour, we know that there is a very long road to fairness ahead of us. But with the passing of marriage equality we take a giant leap forward. With that, I hope that LGBTI Australians can walk a little bit taller, a little bit prouder and a little bit louder in the steps to come, because I'll be walking with you.  The week before last, I marched in Perth's Pride parade alongside Rainbow Labor and the Premier, Mark McGowan. As I was leaving, I was stopped by a group of school students who had also been marching in the parade. They came from different electorates in Western Australia. We smiled at each other and we hugged, and they told me just how much it meant to them for me to be marching on that day. In the grand scheme of things, I suppose marching in a parade is a small gesture of solidarity, but to these young people it meant more than I could ever fathom. It served as a gentle reminder to me that the fight for equality is timeless and that it is carried forward not by my generation, but by generations to come. It reminded me that what we are doing in this House matters. It matters today and it will matter for the tomorrows to come. So, on behalf of those students and on behalf of the LGBTI community in my electorate, I thank the 'yes' campaign, and I thank those in this House and in the Senate for what they have done in sending a clear message that we care: we care today and we will care tomorrow."
48953,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Ben Morton,1,LP,Tangney,1,"I rise today to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. This bill is being debated in this House as a result of the Australian people having their say on marriage in the Australian marriage postal survey. This is not a matter where members have a free vote, where they can vote according to their own conscience on this issue. Members gave up their right to vote according to their own conscience when they supported dealing with this issue by plebiscite, when they decided to give the Australian people their say on whether two people of the same sex should be permitted to marry. Even if members didn't support the survey, they are duty-bound to honour it.  I have made it very clear to my constituents that, if I'd been a member of parliament in 2015, when my party, under Prime Minister Abbott, decided to adopt the position of a plebiscite, I would have argued against it. Parliamentarians are rightly elected in our representative democracy to determine these issues and, in my view, same-sex marriage should have been decided by a free vote according to conscience. That being said, the plebiscite policy was adopted. I accepted it and I was elected with that commitment, as was the government. I've always said that the process to deliver a social change is an important part of the social change itself. Any good process where a decision is made to make a significant social change must result in the broad acceptance of that change, especially from those people who did not support the change itself. The government was elected with a policy of giving Australians their say on the issue of same-sex marriage. The government was, rightly, duty-bound to deliver on that commitment. However, when the government tried to give people their say, the Labor Party frustrated our ability to do so. I strongly believe that the government could not be elected with the policy of giving the Australian people their say, only for that to then be taken away from them. Moreover, you cannot remove the Australian people from the process and then expect those who have opposing views to accept the outcome. This is why I strongly supported the continuation of our plebiscite policy. Sadly, the Labor Party and the Greens killed off legislation to establish the plebiscite in the Senate. Labor and the Greens wanted this issue determined in the corridors of Canberra, without the mandate of the people. I hope, on reflection, they consider the error of their position.  The government, true to their word-and despite opposition from the same-sex marriage lobby, Labor and the Greens-progressed with giving the Australian people their say in a marriage postal survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The government overcame a High Court challenge; we were determined that Australians should be part of this decision. Personally, I actually preferred the postal nature of this ballot, as opposed to having Australians required to attend a polling booth. A real credit to this process is that I've had many 'no' voters contact me in the weeks after the survey results were announced. They were saying that they've accepted the result; they generously accept the will of their fellow Australians. They were not saying that same-sex marriage shouldn't be legislated, and this broad acceptance validates the importance of not taking from people their say, and ensuring that even those people who don't agree with the change can accept it.  My vote on the question 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?' counted no more than anyone else's in my electorate. But I had made it no secret that, if there'd been a free vote in the parliament, I would have voted to maintain the traditional definition of marriage, according to my conscience. The institution and meaning of marriage predate parliament, and I would have had difficulty in parliament taking the role of redefining the term 'marriage'. That said, I would have actively supported the legal recognition of same-sex relationships without using the term 'marriage'. Same-sex couples should be equal before the law, and I'm pleased that past parliaments have removed from federal law discrimination based on someone's sexuality. Same-sex relationships should be recognised under the law.  I could not advocate for a plebiscite and then not respond to the will of the Australian people. In defence of the plebiscite and then the survey, I committed to respecting the will of the Australian people and to making sure that their will was implemented, and that's why I'll be voting yes to the final legislation. The marriage postal survey returned a vote of 61.6 percent in favour of same-sex marriage. My electorate of Tangney was the only electorate to record, to the decimal point, the exact same result as the national result-quite an interesting fact. Seventy-eight thousand, four hundred and twenty-eight, or 84 percent, of the people in Tangney participated in the survey, one of the top 20 response rates in the nation. I respect the opinion and the views of others, and I want to congratulate the 'yes' campaign on their success and the 'no' campaign on their efforts. In the lead-up to the plebiscite there were screams about the impact that the campaign would have on our society, but I always held great respect for the ability of the Australian people to maturely engage in our democracy. On the whole, we should be very proud of the campaign and how we handled it as a society.  There were unfortunate instances that disappointed me. In my own electorate, because of my support for letting the Australian people have their say, my office was vandalised. Signage in my community that includes my image and my contact details as a local member, which was completely unrelated to same-sex marriage, was vandalised. My image was transformed into Hitler's and the word 'Fascist' was added with the words 'marriage equality now'. Also added was that I'm a 'gutless Liberal prick' and I wanted to 'waste $122 million of taxpayers' money on a postal vote'. Criminal damage has no place in our democracy and should be denounced at every opportunity. The damaged property was cleaned, repaired or replaced. I didn't seek media attention; we just moved on. However, the adult, a prominent lead campaigner on the issue who should know better, who gloated publicly about doing some of it and who was caught on CCTV, has been dealt with by the police and in the coming weeks will be dealt with by the courts, as they should be.  As a parliamentarian, I now have to give careful consideration to how to implement the will of the Australian people, how to make sure this process continues in a way that brings Australians together, how we can pass the best possible legislation that delivers same-sex marriage whilst maintaining the freedoms that are so vitally important in Australian society. The Australian people have told us they want same-sex marriage, but they didn't tell us how to do it. It's our job to work that out. Freedom of religion is essential in Australian society, and I'll be considering each amendment very closely to ensure that we maintain freedom of religion and protect the rights of parents to teach their children their religious beliefs. As Menzies said in his Forgotten People address:  When we claim freedom of worship we claim room and respect for all. The amendments to this bill deserve special and careful consideration, and that's what I'll give them. I will be voting for a number of them. There were some amendments proposed and detailed in the media over previous weeks that, in my view, went too far. I could not have supported them. However, the amendments that I was concerned about are not proposed before the House. Other speakers have talked about how this should be a unifying moment for Australia, and it should be. Millions of voters voted yes; millions of voters voted no; more yes than no. We will deliver and I will vote for same-sex marriage this week, but we can deliver same-sex marriage in a way that unifies our nation, respects the will of the Australian people and maintains our freedoms. Let's not lose this unifying opportunity, when we have 'no' voters who, as I've said previously, have accepted the result, who generously accept the will of their fellow Australians and who ask, quite reasonably, that the legislation be passed, with some amendment, to make this historic change and to keep what's good and free about our nation. Conservative governments are best placed to manage significant social change. I'm far happier that this change is happening on our watch rather than under Labor and the Greens, but we need to do it properly. In conclusion, the Australian people have spoken. Same-sex marriage will be legislated, hopefully with amendment, this week. In the same way the member for Warringah so warmly and graciously advised the House that he was looking forward to attending the marriage of his sister, Christine, and her partner, I too look forward to attending the weddings of my gay friends and family members to celebrate the legal recognition of their relationships despite the form of that legal recognition of their relationship not being as I would personally prefer. The Australian people, in partnership with the parliament, have delivered same-sex marriage in the most cohesive way. "
48960,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Justine Keay,0,ALP,Braddon,4," I have a choice, a choice that I am able to make at any time of my adult life. That is a choice to marry. I have chosen at this point not to do so. That is my personal choice. But what we will pass this week, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, is to ensure that every Australian has that same choice, a choice that has been denied to same-sex couples for far too long. My electorate of Braddon voted yes-56 percent-for this choice and for equality. I am proud of my electorate. It has come a long way to demonstrate in this way that it is a progressive and inclusive community. We should never have had this survey, this harmful survey, to tell us exactly what we already knew. But for Braddon-or Tasmania, for that matter-this has not always been the case, and we should never, ever go back.  In respect of gay rights, in the late 1990s, Tasmania was known internationally as 'Bigots' Island' in response to a period of significant social and political turmoil and for having the harshest penalties in the Western world for homosexual activity, until Tasmania finally became the last jurisdiction to repeal such terrible laws, the repeal passing the Legislative Council by one vote in 1997. Braddon, it's fair to say, was probably one of the most homophobic areas in the country. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, our history was marked by explosive anti-gay rallies, reinforcing this perception. These rallies were ill-informed, bigoted and discriminatory.  But, out of these rallies, exceptional people stood up and fought back with strength and determination to change this view of Tasmanians and Tasmania. One of the first people was a young man from my electorate on the north-west coast, Rodney Croome. Supported by his wonderful mother, Bev, who I have had the privilege to doorknock-she's a delight-Rodney has led the way for LGBTIQ people in Tasmania for decades. I ask the House to join with me and pay tribute to Rodney for his tireless dedication to removing discrimination and promoting equality, and he's here in the House with us right now. He is a true hero, not just to the LGBTIQ community but to all of us. I am sure Rodney's journey, and that of all other activists, from those dark days in the 1980s and 1990s to today has been more difficult than I could ever imagine. We should all admire Rodney's tenacity, determination and drive to right this and many other wrongs on this long road to marriage equality. Many people in my community over this long journey have been brought together rather than divided. The first one of these was Dr Tim Flanagan, from Smithton. Dr Flanagan was the only GP in Smithton, and, when an anti-gay rally was held in that community in the late 1980s, Dr Flanagan stood at the rally in solidarity with those being persecuted. From this a group called HUG, Heterosexuals Unafraid of Gays, was formed. This group was the first of many community based organisations to be developed in my region.  In the 1990s, under the leadership of former Devonport mayor Mary Binks, an organisation called Working it Out was formed as a support group for young people negotiating their sexuality. Some 20 years later, Working it Out is now a statewide organisation funded by the Tasmanian government. Other groups include the Diversity Group, from Don College, and Parents, Family and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, or PFLAG. I want to pay tribute to Peter and Mary Moore from PFLAG for their ongoing support for and dedication to removing discrimination so their son Robbie, if he so chooses, can marry, just like his siblings. I also want to pay tribute to Laine Shoebridge-Harris for his tireless work in support of young people from our region. Laine runs a drop-in centre for LGBTIQ people in the city of Burnie. He funds this himself and has lived a life supporting people dealing with the discrimination and hurt that they have faced just because of who they are. Communities, particularly in regional Australia, need more Laines. He is a man with a huge heart and endless compassion.  And now, in the town of Ulverstone, we have pride events. Annie Whitehead from TasPride Tasmania has organised annual pride events in Ulverstone, where people come together to celebrate the diversity we have in our community. I also want to acknowledge Jason Campbell and Alisha Bull from the MUA for hosting campaign events from their offices. Reverend Ian Carmichael from the Penguin Baptist church was the first member of the clergy to offer an apology to the LGBTIQ community in Tasmania. I attended a cross-denominational congregation of like-minded Christians organised by Ian earlier this year to hear Layne speak of his life and to share prayers for those in our community who were struggling during the postal survey. This gave me and others hope. Grant Park and his mother, Tina, from Cafe Europa in Burnie hosted many 'yes' campaign events. However, Grant and his business were a target of fear and hatred during the survey, just because Grant placed rainbow flags along the facade of his business. Disturbingly, Grant received threats to burn down his business and kill his dog. He feared for his safety and that of his staff. How did Grant respond? He hung more flags. We should not gloss over or underestimate the damage this postal survey has caused. Whilst many in this place have celebrated the opportunity for people to have their say, I have always sided on the view that it is wrong for a nation to pass judgement on the identity, the ability to love and the status of one's relationships just because of who they are. Should we pose a national survey to judge whether the Prime Minister should be married to Lucy? It sounds absurd, I know, but this survey was just as absurd, in my view. The result was just as we had expected, at a price that could have been expended elsewhere, but at a larger price on the wellbeing of so many Australians.  Yesterday, disturbing data on the impact of the postal survey was released showing that more than 80 percent of LGBTIQ people and 60 percent of their allies found the marriage equality debate considerably or extremely stressful. Seventy percent of LGBTIQ people said they avoided being with people in general during the survey debate and verbal and physical assaults more than doubled in the three months after the announcement of the postal survey process, compared to the previous six months. I was disturbed and disgusted that the Prime Minister, in his contribution on this bill, said that this was the most remarkable political event in his lifetime. There is nothing remarkable about passing judgement on the love of others in such a public and hurtful way, knowing and having been warned that this process would come at a price to those who have to live through these judgements, the comments and the discrimination, particularly to those without strong networks and support. I have never, ever thought any other way than to support marriage equality. I have never questioned it. Equality is part of my DNA. It is who I am. I have, however, questioned why others do not support it. I wanted to understand the reason they didn't. I had the opportunity to do so while working for a state MP during the debate to legalise same-sex marriage in Tasmania. I read many emails and letters opposing this change. I tried very hard to understand the logic. Some explanations were horrid and abhorrent, and just so wrong. Other reasons for opposition were based in faith, something so intrinsic to a person that I had and continue to have respect for, and I acknowledge that those with strong religious beliefs cannot support same-sex marriage for this reason only.  I will be voting yes. I will not be supporting any further amendments that seek to legalise new ways, new reasons to discriminate. Would I have drafted this bill before us in this way? No. I believe it is a compromise to provide some exclusions for religious civil celebrants. Any more exclusions for others and for other reasons will create new ways to discriminate, and we will never achieve true equality. When I first came into parliament, I wanted my contribution in this place to ensure my children will live in a society that is not just tolerant of others, but is inclusive and celebrates diversity, based on the fundamental principle of equality. We will go some way to achieving that this week. Now we need to continue to move in that direction. "
48961,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Alan Tudge,1,LP,Aston,2,"This will be a historic week, the week that same-sex marriage becomes lawful in Australia. I want to start my contribution on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 today by acknowledging those who have worked very hard to see this change come to fruition, including many individual members of parliament and many people outside of the parliament. The emotional nature of the debate in this place, and particularly by the gay members of parliament, shows how important this change is to so many people. I want to acknowledge this and respect this. Thousands of people across Australia will celebrate the passage of this bill, and, for some, a key ambition of theirs will now be able to be fulfilled. I never considered this debate as being about whether you supported gay relationships or not, and I am disappointed that many equated a 'yes' vote to respecting gay people and a 'no' vote to disrespecting them. My hope is that everybody respects that some people are same-sex attracted and that their relationships are meaningful, complex and loving, just like heterosexual ones. My hope is that we love all people regardless of their sexuality.  My reservations about changing the Marriage Act to include same-sex couples was my view that marriage is an institution that traditionally has been primarily about creating a bond for the creation, love and care of children. And I was concerned that if the definition is changed to be purely one about recognising love, rather than a foundation for the raising of children, then the institution itself would potentially be weakened. I hope I am wrong. I hope that, by expanding the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples, the institution of marriage will be strengthened. My hope is that more couples will take advantage of it, make life-long commitments, and that their relationships will prosper.  There has been a lot of discussion about the manner in which we have got to this outcome. Many have said that we should have dealt with it a long time ago in this parliament through a conscience vote. I disagree. I strongly supported taking this issue to the Australian people and letting them decide. Every poll indicated that people wanted to have a say on this, and the outcome of the postal survey confirmed this with 80 percent participation. Equally importantly, the change to allow same-sex couples to marry has far greater legitimacy because of the public vote, rather than just a vote of 226 members of parliament or a vote of the Supreme Court as occurred in the United States. I would hope that even the most ardent critics of the postal survey would acknowledge this. Marriage is a foundational pillar of society, so changing it was rightly taken to the people to decide. My electorate of Aston voted strongly in favour of changing the law, and consequently I will vote to support the bill before the parliament. This was my public commitment before the postal survey was conducted, and I will honour that commitment. I would like to see reasonable religious protections in place when we make this change to the Marriage Act. My primary concern is that people are not vilified for having traditional views on marriage or for expressing their view. It is deeply disturbing that the Hobart Catholic Archbishop could be in breach of anti-vilification laws because the church circulated a booklet to Catholic parents outlining his traditional view on marriage.  Freedom of speech underpins our democracy, and I don't want to see this fundamental freedom weakened. I am also concerned that religious charities and schools do not lose funding or charitable status because they hold genuine convictions about marriage. Consequently, I will support amendments to this end. If the amendments are not successful now, I hope they will be considered by the Ruddock review into religious freedom and then brought back to this parliament. Let me finish where I started by again acknowledging those who have campaigned hard to see this change happen. But I also acknowledge that almost 40 percent of the Australian public did not support a change. Let's respect the fact that the majority want to change the Marriage Act, but let's respect the 'no' voters and their genuine concerns for religious and speech freedoms. "
48962,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Kate Ellis,0,ALP,Adelaide,1,"I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. I'm really conscious of the fact that, whenever I have previously begun a speech by saying that I won't talk for very long, I've rapidly made a liar out of myself. So I won't claim that now, but I will say that I have spoken over many, many years about my support for marriage equality and it is not my intention to go over that ground here today. I know that, like so many people in the community, what I want to see is this vote done as soon as possible, so I just want to place a few things on the record before allowing other speakers to move on.  The first thing I would say is: I am really delighted to finally be able to support this legislation in the House of Representatives and to see these laws changed forevermore. I am also really deeply sorry that it took so long. I know that in not just years to come but in days and weeks to come, people will be scratching their heads saying, 'What was all of the fuss about? Why didn't we just do this years ago?' That's something that we reflect upon as members of parliament, but I also reflect upon the impact that it's had on so many of our fellow Australians' lives that this has been delayed for so long. The other thing I want to say here today is that whilst this is a huge and very positive step that we are taking, I don't want any member of this parliament to think that with the changing of the marriage laws, with marriage equality in Australia, that means the job is done, because I am firmly of the view that we need leaders in this place to continue the fight to stamp out homophobia in Australian society, and there is a long way to go in that struggle.  I will place on the record that I am the very proud representative of the electorate in South Australia that recorded the highest 'yes' vote, with 70.1 percent of Adelaide voters voting yes. I'm proud to represent that community and proud to represent their wishes when it comes to this vote. I also want to place on the record my thank you and my congratulations to all of the local campaigners in Adelaide. I had the chance to work with some of those in the yes campaign and to see people who came out to go doorknocking in their neighbourhoods, in the streets of Adelaide, who had never before gone out and tried to knock on doors and talk to total strangers about their views. I met people who had never before got involved in a political campaign and who had not got involved in speaking out on policy issues. I met really brave Australians who were going about our local neighbourhoods and explaining why this vote was so important to them. I want to place on the record my heart-felt thanks for those people. I know there was a really hard time had by many. Many people were so appalled by the process this government put us all through, and particularly put the LGBTI community of Australia through, that there were many of them who thought about just sitting it out and turning their backs in disgust on the whole process, but then they realised that if this was the process we had to go through, we had to win it. They stood up, went out, got involved, got active and ran a fantastic local campaign. So thank you to all of those people, and I personally hope that you'll keep involved in local issues and that we will see much more of the new faces who were out there.  I mentioned it was an appalling process. I don't say this to try and make partisan political points here, but I do want to acknowledge what an incredibly hard time this was for so many Australians. There's been a lot of focus on LGBTI Australians and how hard this is. I am also really conscious of the fact that there are a lot of Australians out there who might have been thinking about how they were going to come out, and this made it harder. I spoke to one friend of mine who said that he remembers that in the years before he came out to his family he was looking for signs, because he knew that one day he was going to have to. He was constantly looking for signs. How would his family react? How would the community react? How would the neighbourhood react? I do think about how there would be young people in all of our communities today who are out there looking for these signs and having some of the really appalling materials that were distributed in so many communities placed in front of them, and about the impact that would have on them. I mentioned at the outset that I don't believe that the job's done. I say that because I know that there is everyday homophobia in Australia at a level that every member of this House should say is absolutely unacceptable. We have seen, in our lifetimes, the power of the community to change what is socially acceptable and what's not. I know, in my lifetime, we've seen big changes when it has come to racism in the community. I'm not for a moment saying that the job's done, but I know that there are jokes, there are statements and there are jibes in the schoolyards of 10, 15 or 20 years' ago that would just not be deemed acceptable today. I know that there are changed standards of acceptable behaviour at sporting events and in our community more broadly, because leaders across Australia stood up and demanded that be so. That is the same with racism. That is the same with a whole range of discrimination. It's certainly the case with sexism, though there is a long, long way to go there too.  But we still do still see casual homophobia in Australia and we need to call it out. Too often we see people using the word 'gay' as a jibe. Too often we see criticisms levelled at people who are seen to be soft. Too often we see jokes that are still being made. I don't think that we do call it out in the same way that we do other forms of discrimination. So I would say that, whilst this is a very big step forward-it is a huge step forward and one that we should celebrate-we as leaders of our community should also take this opportunity to recommit to continuing to stamp out all forms of homophobia not just in our laws but also in our neighbourhoods. The reality is that we know that members of the LGBTI community face levels of suicide that are devastatingly high, mental health issues, violence-a range of indicators. This is a group of Australians who are suffering in a way that we as a parliament must always endeavour to prevent.  As I mentioned at the outset, I am really good at saying I'll be quick and then not being quick. I am going to wrap it up there, but I place on the record my thankyou to all of those who have worked and fought so hard to get to this place. My apologies to my fellow Australians that, as a member of this parliament, I've been a part of this being delayed for so long, but I am very, very proud to support changing that law now. I look forward to seeing that done this week. "
48963,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Luke Howarth,1,LP,Petrie,2,"I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. I want to start by congratulating a few people who have been able to get this bill to where it is. In particular I want to acknowledge Liberal National Party members from Queensland-Warren Entsch, the member for Leichhardt, and Trevor Evans, the member for Brisbane-who have wanted to see this change. I congratulate them as fellow members of the Liberal National Party. I also want to congratulate the 'yes' campaign on the win, with 61 percent of Australians voting in support of the question. Congratulations on being able to achieve that. And I want to congratulate the 'no' campaign-the Coalition for Marriage, the Australian Christian Lobby-for standing up and representing the views of the almost 40 percent of people who said no.  As for my personal position on same-sex marriage, I was very clear with what I told people prior to the 2016 election, and that is that I believe marriage is between a man and a woman and for heterosexual relationships only. I believed that same-sex couples, in Queensland at least, already had the same rights through civil unions in Queensland, and that was a position that I took to the last election. To every same-sex couple that asked me directly what my thoughts were on it, I was straight with them and gave them a completely straight answer face to face. The plebiscite has been held. I want to congratulate the Prime Minister on sticking to his word from the last election and giving the people of Australia a say on this matter. He needs to be congratulated. We know that this will become law by the end of the week. Same-sex couples will be able to marry in 2018 after applying for a marriage licence. After the Governor-General signs it off, 28 days later they will be able to marry. The Prime Minister needs to be congratulated. He was a supporter of same-sex marriage, but he stuck to our election commitment to give all Australians a say. I think that was really important and it was one of the only ways to get a result, given that the parliament has had this debate many times before. The last time this question was asked was in 2012, when Julia Gillard was Prime Minister and the Labor Party were in power, and it was defeated. 'No' came across. In fact, the previous member for Petrie, now the state member for Redcliffe, clearly voted no and was part of the reason it didn't go forward.  Every step of the way, the members opposite-the Labor Party-have fought to make sure that the Australian people didn't get a say. Why? I'm not exactly sure. It was probably because they didn't trust the Australian people to say yes and they feared failure in relation to that. So this is a big win for the Prime Minister and for the government.  I actually think that having the plebiscite is a win for same-sex couples as well, because what it says to them is that most Australians agree and want to see the bill go forward-which is important. I disagree with the member for Adelaide and the member for Jagajaga, who say there is still more to do because, in many ways, people said this was the last remaining piece of equality that needed to go through. And when I am out in my community talking to people, people are very respectful of many people. The whole plebiscite debate in my area was conducted very well overall, but I think that it does send a strong message to same-sex couples that, yes, the Australian people have had a say. They voted for yes, the bill will go through by the end of the week and we go from there. I don't really think that the bill itself provides protections for everyone in the community. I think there is a little bit of criticism of this bill outside of the fact that it provides protections for priests and pastors and those religious people who will actually marry same-sex couples. Outside of that and outside church buildings, there are a whole lot of protections that are not mentioned in this bill which could be. Shame on the Labor Party for not voting on the amendments in the Senate last week, for stifling the vote, for not having a free vote there, again, and for ignoring the genuine concerns of many people. The fact is that this week we could do both. We could legalise same-sex marriage and we could also make sure that those protections are put in.  If you look at the front page of The Australian today, one of the articles on there says, 'Schools warn PM on gay marriage'. It says that Simon Benson, head of the one of the most prestigious private schools, located in Malcolm Turnbull's electorate, has warned that unless the Prime Minister secures amendments to the same-sex marriage bill, or the parliament does, to protect faith-based schools, they could be at risk of being defunded or even deregistered. The fact is there are a lot of people that fear that, and I fear that for schools in my own electorate-schools like Mueller College in Rothwell, like Grace Lutheran Primary School at Clontarf, like Grace Lutheran High School at Clontarf and Christ the King Primary School at Deception Bay. The fact is that Protestant and Catholic schools teach that marriage is between a man and a woman. So what does that mean? At the moment they are receiving government funding. Does that mean that down the track, say within the next 10 years, in 2028, they will longer be able to receive government funding because they teach a traditional view of marriage? It is a genuine concern for people, and the parliament could clear it up this week and not skimp on it. I acknowledge the will of the Australian people is to introduce into legislation a change to the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples to marry, and I support that. I said I would listen and represent the views of my electorate and I am doing that. Even though my own personal opinion was for traditional marriage, I will not be standing in the way. I also acknowledge that nearly 40 percent of Australia voted no and that many of those who voted yes did not vote to relinquish their parental rights to decide the moral education of their children, nor did they vote to reduce their freedom of belief, freedom of speech and association. As Senator Abetz outlined last week, 62 percent of Australians believe parliament should guarantee in law for freedom of conscience, belief and religion if it legislates for same-sex marriage. So they want same-sex marriage and they want these freedoms protected. The bill does not provide such protections, in my opinion.  The Australian people were assured that religious freedom is fundamental and that it would be protected in any bill that emerges from this parliament. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Inquiry into the status of the human right to freedom of religion or belief found that, overall, the evidence supports the need for current protections for religious freedom to be enhanced. However, basic protections for parental rights and freedom of religion were rejected by the Senate last week. What confidence can I give to the constituents of my electorate and to the nearly 70 percent of Australians who hold some form of religion, according to the 2016 census, that any recommendations from the Ruddock review will be supported by the upper House? I don't want to say I hope they will be supported; they should be supported. Unfortunately, as acknowledged by submissions to the Senate committee, Australian law, in contrast to the strong and clear protections for religious freedom under international law-article 18 of the ICCPR-provides weak and inadequate protection for freedom of religion and belief. International experience clearly demonstrates the consequences for Australia if we do not provide adequate protections for fundamental freedoms.  The legislation for change, as it stands, provides minimal protections, to the point of being non-existent, for freedom of religion and conscience for a significant proportion of our citizens. Will parents, foster carers, schools, charities and individuals have their strongly-held beliefs protected? Or will we, in attempting to fast-track legislation before Christmas, impose no religion as the state religion on our pluralistic, tolerant society, and drive religion and conscience from the public square through the threat of antidiscrimination laws? The inevitable intolerance and discrimination in the name of tolerance is disturbing. Here, right now, this week, the parliament has an opportunity to represent all Australians, to bring about the change to the Marriage Act to include same-sex couples-100 percent-while also protecting the freedom of conscience and belief of many Australians.  There have been a lot of people in my electorate who have contacted me in relation to making sure those freedoms are protected. Here I have an email from Christine in North Lakes. She said: If you cannot stop this bill-  we don't want to stop the bill; we want it to go through and honour the plebiscite, which it will this week, as promised, despite the nay-sayers on the other side in the Labor Party- please do what you can to support amendments to this bill that include freedoms for those who do not agree with this bill. I also have an email from Alana, a grandmother in Deception Bay. She says: As a 'no' voter, I'm very concerned about the rush to push through [same-sex marriage] into law in its current form. There are totally inadequate safeguards for freedom of speech and protection of each person's right to defend their beliefs and way of life. An email from Marty Harnisch from Redcliffe says: Hi Luke Please represent us in protecting religious freedoms, freedom of speech and the right of children to innocence in the wake of the postal survey results. I am so so concerned about the sexualisation of children and exposing them to confusion with the 'Safe Schools' curriculum ...  Come on, little ones can't make decisions on these things! Please protect the church and the church schools so they can be the pillars of society I know they are. The member for Hotham, when she spoke on this the other day, said that her feedback showed the No. 1 concern was in relation to Safe Schools. Down in Bald Hills, in the southern part of my electorate, Ian says: Dear Luke I am a Bald Hills resident ... With this battle now lost- he was obviously a 'no' voter- and the bill to be presented to Parliament, I am absolutely fuming that religious protections promised at the outset have been dumped by The Senate. This was written last week. This is a pathway to inevitable Safe Schools ... with parents having no say into this indoctrination by withdrawing their children without facing the weight of the law. I say to the parliament, and to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, that there is genuine concern in relation to the bill, and there is absolutely no reason why same-sex marriage cannot be passed this week while also ensuring that those religious protections make sure that the country that we have, the freedom that we have to express our faith and our views, will remain.  Once again, I condemn the Labor Party for ensuring that they do not have a conscience vote on this matter; that they vote en bloc. They did everything they could to make sure the Australian people did not have a say on this matter. The fact is: the government had a mandate, after the 2016 election, to make sure we gave the Australian people a say. We did. They voted yes. Marriage equality will be law by the end of the week. I will not be standing in the way, but at the same time I make the strongest argument to the parliament that we need to make sure that religious protection is upheld. I'll leave it with the parliament. Thank you."
48964,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Rob Mitchell,1,ALP,McEwen,4,"The simple answer is no, I will not support the amendments, but on the question of marriage equality it is a resounding yes. I want to clear up, for anyone listening, the absolute lies put forward time and time again by those who want to continue with discrimination. Labor has a conscience vote. We are here today because they would not allow themselves a conscience vote in 2012. Labor has always had a conscience vote. We looked at those amendments en bloc and said, 'They're all rubbish; they're all crap; we're not supporting them.' We did that as a bloc to say, 'Let's not waste time; let's get on with it.'  Australia has voted yes, so now it's time for this House to do its job. By removing discrimination for LGBTIQ people this week, we will finally be granting them the same rights as everyone else. When I look back at the history of the Australian LGBTIQ community, I can't help but mourn over the abhorrent treatment they have received throughout the years. From institutionalised criminalisation for their relationships to hate crimes and so many more injustices, they've fought tirelessly to have their love acknowledged as just that-love. For this horrible past, we are deeply sorry. For anyone out there who is questioning or is scared or worried about how others will react, you have to know that we accept you, we welcome you and we will fight for you. I am proud to represent the seat of McEwen, which had the highest response rate of every seat in every state, with over 112,000 people having their say on marriage equality. That figure outdoes the turnout for the 2013 election, which is a phenomenal feat, and I'm happy that we voted 65.4 percent yes. That is a clear, concise position from a progressive and engaged community. It's time-it's past time-to change our marriage laws to reflect the diversity that Australia is built upon. It's time to legalise same-sex marriage and send a loud, clear message that Australia cherishes equality and diversity. You are equal.  The LGBTIQ community has been through enough. The postal survey was a demoralising exercise, and it did impact on the mental and physical health of thousands of Australians. A survey-not a plebiscite!-conducted by the Australian Institute and the National LGBTI Health Alliance has shown us just how deep the hurt has been. The number of verbal and physical assaults against LGBTIQ people doubled during the postal survey. Anxiety, depression and stress rose by over a third during that survey. Yet our PM says he's proud of that achievement, he's proud of that survey. He is wrong to celebrate all of the unnecessary hardship he has inflicted on the LGBTIQ community and the mental strain that his actions resulted in. This week he stood here praising how great the survey was and what a wonderful thing he did, whilst totally ignoring the hurt, the pain and the division he created because of his weak leadership. I hope that soon the PM, for the first time in his political career, will have the courage of his convictions and vote yes for marriage equality. To make it clear, and in support of the powerful message from Rob Stott at Junkee:  ... we got here in spite of Malcolm Turnbull, not because of him. We've seen the distribution of amendments. These amendments are a smokescreen to dilute discrimination laws-amendments to put one group above others in our law. What we are seeing is amendments put forward under the guise of religious freedoms-funnily enough, by the same people over there who want to ban the burka. So, they want religious freedoms but they want to ban the burka. They're not about religious freedoms but they are about pushing one religion above all others. As section 116 of the Constitution says, freedom of religion is in our laws. There is freedom for people to practise their religion; it is not freedom to impose it on everyone else. They may not want their churches to participate in same-sex marriages-and they have the right to choose not to, and I support that right for the churches-but it doesn't mean that you can stand in the way of marriage equality or discriminate against people. It is time to say enough is enough. The postal survey has happened. It is our responsibility to legislate, to support the overwhelmingly positive responses from the Australian people.  I don't support exemptions for celebrants based on their personal religious views. They are already covered by section 47 of the Marriage Act. They can refuse to marry any couple. But I am not going to let my personal views on this point stand in the way of this legislation. We have put the LGBTIQ community through so much unnecessary pain. I think about all of those Canberra couples who invested their time, their energy and their love to get married, just to have it ripped away by a government hell-bent on promotion of discrimination. Think of them for just one minute. Think of the pain and heartache those opposite caused.  In my work and personal life, I've had and still have some great and incredible LGBTIQ friends, and their stories have motivated me strongly to support this legislation. There were two blokes I met at the Wallan market a little while ago; 40 years they've been together-40 years waiting for the opportunity to celebrate their love like everyone else can. And I remember I got a phone call from an old mate-an old colleague, Coops-and she was rightly angry that marriage equality had failed to pass in 2012. We talked about the issue, and through a tear she said, 'Us gay kids are sick of having our hopes built up time and time again.' We let her down, we let all the gay kids down and we let the country down. And that call made me steadfast in my commitment. We owed Coops and we owed the whole LGBTIQ community the right to be free to marry the one that they love if they choose to. I'm sorry it has taken so long. In the end, love is love. LGBTIQ Australians have to have the right to celebrate that love in the way other Australians have been doing for so long. So enough with the amendments, which aren't relevant to this bill at all. Enough with the attempts to delay what's right. Let's get it done and get it done now. No more should we hear of 'marriage equality', because after this bill passes, marriage is marriage is marriage: a commitment between two consenting adults regardless of their gender. "
48965,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Julia Banks,0,LP,Chisholm,1,"It gives me great pleasure to rise today in this debate on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 in celebration of Australia's resounding yes to marriage equality. I'm particularly proud to note that 82.4 percent of the people of Chisholm participated in the marriage equality postal survey and that 61.6 percent of my electorate of Chisholm voted in favour of marriage equality. There was national jubilation on 15 November 2017, upon the announcement of the postal survey result which, in effect, means significant and heartwarming social reform. 2017 is the year when we are embracing this change and it will remain etched in history as the year of one of the most momentous social reforms in our history.  I've always been on the public record as supporting marriage equality. Marriage equality is about equality before the law. It's about fairness, it's about love and it's about family. I'm so incredibly proud to be a member of the House of Representatives under the leadership of our Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the first Prime Minister in the history of Australia to have always unequivocally and consistently supported same-sex marriage. It was always the Turnbull government that promised Australians a right to have their say. The Labor Party blocked the plebiscite, which could have taken place earlier this year, despite the fact that the Turnbull government had a mandate from the Australian people, being an elected majority government at the 2016 federal election. During the 2016 federal election campaign, I personally promised hundreds of people that, under the Turnbull government, we would ensure that Australians would have a right to have their say-that their vote would count as much as mine. Notwithstanding the roadblocks consistently put up by the Labor Party to deny Australians a right to have their say, the Turnbull government found a way. At every turn, the Labor Party attempted to block our attempts to enable Australians to have their say with the plebiscite, and then, with the postal vote, our opponents continued to say that the postal vote wouldn't work because there wouldn't be a turnout for the vote. We maintained the integrity of that promise to the Australian people, because that's what the Turnbull government does. We don't break the promises that we make to Australians. We kept that promise and Australia has spoken loud and clear on marriage equality.  Chisholm, and Australia, overwhelmingly voted to assert that two loving people can now get married in our great country. During the postal voting period, some said it was 'courageous' and 'risky' of me to be so vociferous in supporting marriage equality as an MP of a marginal seat of such diverse multicultural communities. But I've always believed that fighting for marriage equality was never about political courage or resilience; rather, it's about standing for equality for all, regardless of gender, race, sexuality or ethnicity. Chisholm is one of Australia's most multiculturally diverse electorates. The results in Chisholm speak for themselves. Cultural background is no barrier to embracing equality and it is wrong to assume that people vote in line with their ethnicity. While a number of people voted no in this debate, the Turnbull government respects and acknowledges their vote, and I have no doubt that they will respect this truly democratic outcome. Respectful debate is the cornerstone of our democracy, and telling Australians how to vote was not the way to go, and some did a disservice to their cause on both sides for their behaviour and overreaching statements. I love that Australians are decent people and known around the world for their goodwill and camaraderie towards others. This is overwhelmingly evident throughout our community in Chisholm.  Fundamental liberal values are premised on family as the priority, and freedom of religion and freedom of speech. The change to the law will amend the definition of 'marriage' and protect religious freedoms. In relation to family being a priority, I also believe wholeheartedly that children only need two things in life: love and stability. Early in my legal career, when I practised in family law, I saw firsthand that love and stability are not automatically afforded to children simply because they have a mother and a father. The presence of love and stability is not limited to traditional nuclear families such as my own. Rather, it's in the homes of single parents, widows, divorced and separated parents, same-sex parents, grandparents, aunties, uncles and special friends, regardless of their gender or sexuality.  This week, I'm incredibly proud to vote yes in our parliament and represent the majority of Chisholm voters. Chisholm has voted, and I am voting, to recognise relationships between same-sex couples as being as legitimate as those of other couples. A 'yes' vote is an acknowledgement that social mores change and should be reflected in a change to the law. Chisholm and Australia overwhelmingly voted to assert that two loving people can now get married in our country. This vote tells us never to underestimate the Australian people and never to underestimate the greatness of our country. The Australian people have resoundingly used their voice to enable all to live their lives in this country with optimism and faith, regardless of their gender, ethnicity or sexuality. Last week, we celebrated the successful passage of the marriage amendment bill in the other place, and I look forward to honouring our commitment to the Australian people that the Turnbull government will work towards having marriage equality in place before Christmas. The Australian people are the greatest people on earth, and they have voted for a fair, equal and modern Australia."
48966,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Michelle Rowland,0,ALP,Greenway,2,"I'm voting for this bill, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, and it is a fact that the electorate of Greenway, which I represent, voted no. I would like to address some of the commentary that's been circulating about seats in Western Sydney that voted no, including Greenway, where the split was 46.4 percent yes to 53.6 percent no in the marriage equality survey. It was not an overwhelming no, but it was a no nonetheless.  Many experts have emerged on the result of the marriage equality survey as it applies to Western Sydney. There's been a whole lot of analysis about why a bloc of Western Sydney seats voted no. Some of the reasons given are religion and ethnicity-sometimes even citing alleged correlations with low educational attainment. We've had case studies of people from ethnically diverse backgrounds who voted no. I must say that much of the commentary about Western Sydney treats it like some amorphous, homogenous zone, not of people but of labels. I hear the blanket statement that migrants voted no coming mostly from the same people who talk about this thing called the ethnic vote or the migrant vote. That term is ignorant and insulting, and I scorn it. It's disrespectful. It consigns people to be defined not for who they are as an individual. I, in fact, know many local residents from migrant backgrounds who voted yes. It is such a simplistic and erroneous notion to suggest that everyone from a migrant background voted no. In the moment of excitement when the results of the survey were being revealed, my electorate and others around it were being analysed by people who don't know Greenway, and they showed great disrespect both for people who voted yes and for people who voted no. The people of Greenway deserve better than some of these people, some of these armchair experts-some of those people who also sit in this parliament. I would like to point out, for example, the republic referendum in 1999. Have a look at the way Western Sydney seats voted. On socially conservative issues, Western Sydney seats have, by and large, voted no. Greenway voted no in the 1999 referendum. It was a 'no' of something in the order of 55 percent, a 'no' to Australia becoming a republic. There were other seats in Western Sydney that voted no on that occasion: Blaxland, Chifley, Parramatta and, whilst there has been a redistribution, the then seat of Prospect and the seat of Werriwa. The suggestion that we can define what has resulted from the marriage equality survey in Western Sydney by ethnicity alone is very erroneous. There is definitely a correlation of a socially conservative vote, and it's been there for a long time. I for one am not at all surprised by the marriage equality survey result, because in fact it reflects almost to the exact percentage my own surveys-my own mobile offices, my own consultations with the electorate-that I have done in the electorate of Greenway over many years.  You only have to look at the latest census results for Greenway to see that, yes, we are a very ethnically diverse area. In fact, 45.5 percent of residents in the electorate of Greenway were born overseas, well above the national average of 33.3 percent, and the percentage of people in Greenway with both parents born overseas is 55.8 percent, compared to the national average of 34.4 percent. So, in effect, what commentators are saying when they try to equate the results in Greenway with the level of ethnic diversity is that just about everyone born overseas voted no. I don't buy that for a second. I think the notion that some people are trying seriously to assert, that every one of those people who voted no did so because they were of migrant background, is simply erroneous. I think it's right up there with what a lot of people, not from ethnic backgrounds, say about why we don't need protections against racist hate speech. It's right up there. So I think it is incredibly disappointing that there was an immediate look, an immediate conclusion, about this so-called migrant vote in Western Sydney, and that many people drew conclusions just to claim that these people who voted no were homophobic. Many people voted yes. Religious reasons were one factor, cultural reasons were another factor and socially conservative reasons that have been there for a long time were yet another. I'll tell you what it comes down to: it comes down to respect. That's exactly what I said on the day the survey results were announced. I said this:  I acknowledge that many residents have strong views one way or the other for or against marriage equality based on factors such as personal experience, religious beliefs or cultural norms. Each and every one of those people should be respected for their views.  In mid-2015, when I was asked about these matters-and this goes to something that I've held very dear, particularly since I had the honour of serving as shadow minister for citizenship and multiculturalism in the last parliament-I said this: As I've been going around for the last 18 months, around the country talking about inclusiveness, I find it increasingly difficult to reconcile the whole gamut of inclusiveness and people being part of our society and being able to contribute to it without having a negative approach to marriage equality. That's a view that I have formed over the last 18 months, but I made a commitment to my electorate that I would go out, listen to their views and as I have a conscience vote that's how I've decided I will exercise that vote ... I was also asked whether that meant I was leaning towards a 'yes'. And I said:  That's correct, but I've given you an example of some of the arguments that have been put to me and look, there's other people who have told me they have no objection to many of the laws or any of the laws that Labor put in place to assure equality on different points, but for them, the stickler is on the issue of marriage. They see marriage as an institution that is particularly defined as between a man and a woman, and for these people their minds are not going to change. So as a Member of Parliament I need to be respectful of all these things, but again at the end of it I realise the way in which I vote is not going to make everyone happy. I just want it to be an informed decision that is also as representative as it can be of my constituency. Lastly, I was asked about whether diversity and multiculturalism has an impact on this issue. And I responded:  I think you should never stereotype people based on their ethnicities. I have had people from a variety of cultural backgrounds give me very different views on this matter. Not only in the last couple of days but in the last couple of years. I think it is very wrong to simply pigeonhole people based on their ethnicity for any reason and on this issue of marriage equality I don't think you should be pigeonholing people either. You need to listen to them, but I think Members of Parliament should inform their views based on what they believe to be right, but also be informed by their constituency. And that is exactly what I have done in leading to my declaration, some time ago, that I will be voting yes on this matter. I would also like to point out the large number of people in the electorate of Greenway who enrolled to vote as a result of this postal survey being conducted. When you have a look at the monthly statistics for new enrollees, we had 580 just before the cut-off cycle. On the cycle afterwards, after the survey cut-off date, we had 394. But on the cycle for the cut-off date-new electors who enrolled in Greenway, one of the fastest growing regions of New South Wales and Australia-we had a massive 1,557 new enrollees. I want to congratulate all those people. I know many of them would have been young people who were exercising a vote on a matter for the first time. I would like to thank them for enrolling to vote.  I would like to end with some comments around the issue of religious freedoms. I want to start by quoting the instructive words of Vincent Long, the Bishop of Parramatta. As a Catholic myself, I find Bishop Long inspirational. In his pastoral letter on the postal survey he said: It is important to remember from the very outset that the postal survey is about whether or not Australians want the legal definition of civil marriage changed to include same-sex couples. It is not a referendum on sacramental marriage as understood by the Catholic Church.  Many years ago, divorce was legalised in Australia; but this change did not alter the law of the Church. Therefore, whatever the outcome of the survey or the eventual legislation by the government, the Church will continue to hold that marriage is a natural institution established by God to be a permanent union between one man and one woman ... It is very clear, and I know well, that many people have concerns that their freedom to practice religion might be impacted by a change in the law in relation to marriage equality. On this side of the House we have made it very clear that we are committed to ensuring that religious freedoms are appropriately protected. We don't believe that religious freedoms and marriage equality are mutually exclusive, and, on that point, I would like to highlight that there has been a panel appointed. It is chaired by Philip Ruddock and includes other eminent people who will be looking at this issue. It should be looked at-it is important, as Australia becomes more and more culturally and religiously diverse, that we ensure our laws keep pace with that. I want to end by thanking the mother who approached me in Seven Hills some time ago. She gave me a very important perspective. Her son is on active service in the Navy and wants to marry his partner. This man is putting his life on the line in service to Australia, and that woman asked me, 'Who are you to deny my son, who is serving the nation, the right to marry the person he loves?' She is right. "
48967,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Kevin Andrews,1,LP,Menzies,2,"At the heart of this debate is a simple but profound question: what is the meaning and purpose of marriage? For the proponents of change, the answer is simple: it is about love and equality. But, for millions of others, the answer is different and more complex. For them, marriage is a union between a man and a woman. It is a natural institution upon which all other relationships are founded-the means of having and protecting children and forming communities and nations. For them, it is a pre-political institution, a natural arrangement that predates forms of government and for which the government only has an involvement in order to protect the people historically most vulnerable-namely, children. While elements of both meanings can be found in modern marriage, the latter group believes that the primary purpose is having and protecting children. Indeed, it is a view which has prevailed across civilisations and cultures for millennia. These different understandings of marriage will not be resolved by the passage of this bill, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. In fact, it has highlighted them.  For some people, the belief in the traditional meaning of marriage is an innate understanding. For some it is an appreciation of the natural law, for others a conscientiously held belief. However described, it goes to the core of universally recognised human rights. In December 1948, the international community gathered at the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Confronted by the horrors of the Second World War and egregious breaches of human rights in many places, world leaders sought to enshrine standards of conduct that respected the inherent dignity and liberty of each human being. Led by the redoubtable Eleanor Roosevelt, the Human Rights Committee of the new organisation had worked for nearly two years to draft the declaration. Australia was a significant supporter of the creation of the United Nations and also the universal declaration. Central to the declaration is the bold assertion that:  ... human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want ... which should be protected by rule of law. Article 18 of the declaration states:  Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance. As the Harvard professor of law Mary Ann Glendon done points out in her masterful account of the creation of the declaration, A World Made New, article 18 was a major achievement of the Human Rights Committee. Two decades later, the international community concluded a long process to transform the declaration into an international legal instrument. Hence, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was drafted and adopted. Amongst the supporters, again, was Australia. The covenant expands article 18 of the declaration with three additional provisions. First, no-one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice; second, freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others; and, third, the nations that are signatories to the covenant 'undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and, when applicable, legal guardians to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions'. Australia is a signatory to that covenant but it has not been incorporated into our domestic law. A number of observations can be made about the protection of religion and belief in Australia. First, there is an international definition and standard of freedom of religion and belief that Australia has long supported. Accordingly, there is an objective measure by which the adequacy or otherwise of protections in Australia can be measured. The standard in article 18 of the covenant has also been interpreted by the United Nations committee from time to time. But it's also clear that there is very little legal protection for freedom of religion and belief in Australia. This is consistent with the evidence from experts to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry into the status of the human right to freedom of religion or belief that I currently chair and which released its interim report about freedom of religion in Australia just this week. Section 116 of the Australian Constitution is limited in its scope, according to these same experts, and does not provide the range of protections covered by the international covenant. Nor does it protect against states restricting religious freedom.  So, these considerations are pertinent to the current same-sex marriage debate. The Senator Smith bill contains very little protection for religion and belief. Indeed, it is limited to the conduct of the marriage ceremony. The range of protections envisaged by the international covenant is missing. To claim that there will not be a range of adverse consequences for the freedom of speech, religion and parental rights in the absence of laws envisaged in the covenant is wrong. A significant concern that millions of Australians have about these proposed changes to marriage laws is the manner in which the freedom of speech and religion is threatened. These concerns are harboured by many people who favour the change, not just by those who oppose it. Their concerns are not fanciful. Already there has been a series of events that bear out the fears. So a bishop is dragged before a tribunal for simply expounding Catholic beliefs. A company retreats from a Twitter storm because it was associated with a respectful debate between two members of parliament about same-sex marriage. A business executive is hounded by activists to resign from the board of a Christian education institution. A sports star is harangued for expressing the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. A university is pressured about an academic who supports a Christian foundation-and this issue was argued in the name of diversity; a diversity that tolerates just one view. These and other instances have occurred while marriage is still legally defined in this country as being between a man and a woman.  For almost 70 years Australia has subscribed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and for half a century to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including the important and significant rights to freedom of religion and belief. These are clear, universal and objective provisions that should be protected and, unless they are, proponents of the no case have good reason to assert that human rights in Australia will be diminished as a consequence of the passage of this bill. The great irony of this debate is that the proponents of change are claiming a right to marry which is not recognised in international legal human rights jurisprudence while denying on the other hand the rights of conscience and belief that are clearly stated and subscribed to.  So the bottom line is this: Australians who believe that marriage is and will always be a union of a man and a woman should be free to profess and manifest that belief and not face the possibility of being hauled before a tribunal. Charities which operate on this understanding should not face the prospect of their charitable status being repealed. Schools founded on this principle should not be threatened with deregistration. And celebrants who subscribe to the traditional understanding of marriage should not be forced to participate in a wedding contrary to their beliefs. This is a conscience debate. Accordingly, it would be strange if members were to ignore or abandon their conscience in coming to a decision on how to vote. Sir Thomas More once said,  ... when statesmen forsake their own private conscience for the sake of their public duties ... they lead their country by a short route to chaos. In coming to a decision I am mindful that 47 percent of my constituents and 57 percent of those who voted supported a change. But I'm also mindful that many, including those who supported change, want to see the protection of conscience and belief in this bill. It is for these reasons that I will support the proposed amendments to uphold and protect freedom of conscience and belief. It's not my desire to stand in the way of the view expressed by the majority of those who voted in the survey, but I want to ensure that this bill promotes, rather than undermines, freedom of conscience and belief."
48968,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Amanda Rishworth,0,ALP,Kingston,2,"I am so pleased to be here today to be part of making marriage equality law in this country with this Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. Over five years ago I voted yes for marriage equality in this parliament. At the time I said that my belief in fairness, equality, compassion and the importance of striving for a world without discrimination meant that I had no choice but to vote for a change to the Marriage Act to ensure same-sex couples had the right to marry the person they love. For me this sentiment is as true today as it was back in 2012. While marriage equality did not become law in 2012, this week, five years or more later, we will finally see the law changed to allow two people who love each other to make a lifelong commitment to each other, and this commitment will now be properly recognised in Australia's law.  This has certainly been a long time coming for the LGBTIQ community. The persistence over so many years of so many activists and supporters who have not given up, who have made the case time and time again to politicians and the wider community, is to be commended and celebrated. Your work over the years really does show that persistence pays off. For so many people and families in my electorate, I know that the postal vote process was extremely difficult, but I was inspired by so many locals in the southern suburbs of Adelaide that I met who, despite the process being personally difficult, decided to campaign for a 'yes' vote because they knew, whatever the personal consequence, it was the right thing to do.  In particular, I would like to make mention of one group in the southern suburbs: Pride of the South, a group who for many years have provided support and promoted inclusion for our LGBTIQ community members. The group actively worked together to have conversations with members of our community, to tell their stories about why voting yes was so important. In fact there were so many people who shared their stories around the country. These people were brave, they were strong and they were determined. I want to take this opportunity to thank the Pride of the South Committee for both their efforts during the 'yes' campaign and their ongoing work in supporting our LGBTIQ community. They are Llewellyn Jones, Shayne Glaslow, William Rattley, Mel Bennett, Jen Sobey, Marc Roberts, Michael Tomas and Annette Wedding. They have shown immense leadership and courage, and I salute them. I would also like to thank the Flinders University Queer Society for the extensive work they did in support of the yes campaign in the south-in particular, Sean Henschke, who worked tirelessly and with so much passion to get the message across. I would also like to thank Jemma Slevec, who lent her support to the South Says Yes campaign. There were many people who volunteered all around the country, and I would like to thank them also. I would like to thank those who fought for change in South Australia, but I would particularly like to mention Emmanuel Cusack, who is in the gallery tonight, who coordinated the yes campaign in South Australia. I know that this campaign was a labour of love for you, but it was also a huge amount of work. The support gained through the results in South Australia and in my electorate show that your campaign had a huge amount of support, and your work is testimony to that.  Throughout the survey process, there were some people who did try to make the debate about something else. They tried to make the debate about Safe Schools, about freedom of speech and about political correctness, but it wasn't about any of those things. It was simply about one thing-equality before the law. It was about giving LGBTIQ Australians the same right as everyone else. It was about acknowledging that Australia is not a country of discrimination. We are a country of acceptance, equality and diversity. Now, there is one misconception that people listening to this debate might not recognise, and that is that there are religious protections in this bill. No minister of religion is required to solemnise marriage. There is no watering down of the current religious protections. This is merely about equality, it is about fairness and it is about love. Throughout the survey process, I spoke to a lot of local people who shared their personal stories with me, and I would like to thank them for doing that. Talking about yourself is a difficult thing to do. Sharing deeply personal information is difficult, and I value those stories that you shared with me. I would like to share a few with the House. There was one gentleman who has two sons, one gay and one straight. He said that he loves his sons equally and that all he really wants is for them both to be treated equally under the law. I spoke to many same-sex couples with children, who told me that all they really want is for their families to be given the same respect and certainty as every other family in this country.  There is one story in particular that I wish to share with the House today, and that is the story of Llewellyn and his life partner, Lyndon. The past weekend marked 10 years since Lyndon asked Llewellyn to marry him. After their engagement, Lyndon and Llewellyn waited patiently for same-sex marriage to be legalised so that they could finally formalise their love and get married. In 2010, devastatingly, Lyndon passed away. Llewellyn shared his story with many people during the survey process. Llewellyn said that he will live with the grief forever that he was not able to marry the love of his life. What he wants now is to ensure that this never happens to anyone else, and that is why I am so incredibly pleased and proud to be part of this parliament as we legalise for marriage equality, because this legislation ensures couples like Lyndon and Llewellyn will never have to wait again to be treated equally. Today, this parliament is saying to every LGBTIQ Australian: 'We accept you for who you are. You are enough. You are equal.'"
48969,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Rick Wilson,1,LP,O'Connor,4,"I rise today to acknowledge the overwhelming support expressed by the Australian people for changing the definition of marriage and to put my own position on the record as we debate the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. But, firstly, let me wish all of the same-sex couples planning to marry the same joy of marriage that my wife, Tanya, and I have shared in our 17 years together.  Let's look first at a little history on this issue. In 2012 during the 43rd Parliament, legislation to reform the Marriage Act was brought before the parliament and voted down. It is worth noting that in opposition many of those who had previously voted no suddenly became zealous reformers. At the 2016 election, the coalition parties took a very clear policy to the people of Australia: that we would give the Australian people the opportunity to have their say on this momentous change to the institution of marriage in our country via a compulsory attendance plebiscite. When enabling legislation was put to the Senate in February this year it was cynically voted down by the Labor Party and the Greens. I do note with some irony that all celebrations currently taking place could have occurred eight months ago if not for the political opportunism of those opposite. Despite being confronted with this roadblock, the government was determined to uphold its commitment to the Australian people, so we facilitated a non-compulsory postal plebiscite. As we all know, and as many in this place have acknowledged, the postal plebiscite has been a resounding success. Despite all of the naysayers predicting doom, 79 percent of Australians took the opportunity to have their say, and I am very proud to say that, apart from a couple of isolated incidents across the nation of 24 million people, we conducted the debate in a respectful and dignified manner. The 61.2 percent vote in favour of changing our definition of marriage was resounding and gives enormous legitimacy to the reform this parliament is about to pass. Across my electorate of O'Connor the vote was 56.2 percent yes and 43.8 percent no, with a response rate of 75.7 percent. While this was the lowest 'yes' vote across Western Australia, it's a very definitive result.  My personal position, as reflected in my first speech in this place in 2013, and as has been put consistently on the public record, is that I support the traditional definition of marriage, but I would not stand in the way of the will of the Australian people by voting against a bill to reform the Marriage Act if that is what the Australian people voted for. Having said that, I have always reserved my right, once the overall passage of the bill was assured, to abstain from voting if the bill brought before the parliament failed to contain protections for religious beliefs, conscience and freedom of speech.  Whilst acknowledging the current bill does contain some protections for ministers of religion in relation to performing marriage ceremonies, I don't believe that the broader community is sufficiently protected. The nearly five million Australians who voted no are the new forgotten people. I don't see big business, tertiary institutions, the public service, unions, the media or governments supporting their rights. During the plebiscite, a young woman in Canberra called Madeline was sacked from her job simply for posting on Facebook that she supported the traditional definition of marriage. The Archbishop of Hobart, Julian Porteous, was recently dragged before the antidiscrimination commission for sharing Catholic Church teachings on marriage with Catholic school students. In a British example, the High Court recently supported a Derby City Council decision that a Christian couple who had successfully fostered many children were no longer suitable foster carers due to their traditional and religious views on marriage and their noncompliance in promoting or accepting same-sex attracted lifestyles. As the father of four young children, I am particularly concerned about retaining the right to protect them being taught radical sexual fluidity concepts at school until they are of an age and maturity to make an informed decision. Any decision that my kids make in the future I will respect and support. I'll always love them unconditionally and with all of my heart.  I, myself, have been on the receiving end of personal attacks from those who disagree with my views and spew vitriol on Facebook and via email. I have been labelled homophobic, which I am certainly not, and have been called things that cannot be repeated in this place. As a politician, that's an unfortunate part of my job, but I look for no sympathy. I am not prepared to expose the 33,000 people in O'Connor who voted no to the sort of abuse I have recently received. I am particularly concerned about the winner-takes-all attitude of the many people who have contacted me since the announcement of the result. There appears to be little love in their hearts for those who have the temerity to disagree with them, and this has only strengthened my resolve. To that end, I am aware of a series of amendments that will be introduced after this second reading debate. I will be supporting amendments that seek to protect free speech, protect freedom of religion and conscience, and provide certainty for religious charities and schools. If, as I sincerely hope will be the case, these amendments are passed, I will be voting in favour of the final bill. If the amendments fail, I cannot in all conscience vote for a bill that will expose constituents in my electorate to the danger of persecution, vilification and legal proceedings for simply following their long-held faith and beliefs, and I will be abstaining. "
48970,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Mike Freelander,1,ALP,Macarthur,2,"There has been a lot of hot air expressed in the last few days about this bill, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. I'm a conservative 64-year-old doctor who's been married to his wife for 38 years and who really feels that this is a human rights issue. I fundamentally believe that sexuality is biologically determined. On that premise and that premise alone, I believe that marriage equality is a human rights issue and that we need to pass this bill without amendment.  I have seen many, many children in my career as a paediatrician. I never judged them on their possible sexuality and I never believed that any child should be treated differently to another. This bill is about whether we as Australians and as members of parliament believe that all Australians are equal. In fact, the Australian Human Rights Commission considers that 'the fundamental human rights principle of equality means that civil marriage should be available, without discrimination, to all couples, regardless of sex, sexual orientation or gender identity'. It just isn't right that we effectively persecute a proportion of our population based on their sexuality. To not afford same-sex couples the same rights as those that are heterosexual is effectively saying that their relationship is not equal, that their love is not equal and that their commitment to one another is somehow less significant than others-and I don't believe that that should happen. We shouldn't be judging people on their sexuality. It was, indeed, a joyous day when it was announced that the majority of Australians voted to allow all Australian couples of the same sex to have the same rights to a recognised civil marriage. It was a day on which Australians proved to this government and the world that we believe in equality. I didn't believe that the postal survey was the right thing to do and I still do believe that it did a lot of damage. I apologise to the many people who felt harmed by this-and there, indeed, were a number.  It really is time to move away from the misconceptions that are still being proposed by many people who oppose marriage equality. These misconceptions include things like 'being gay is a choice' or that it can be taught and untaught. As a paediatrician for nearly 40 years, I and the research can assure you it's biology. It's nothing other than biology. The notion that a person can somehow choose their sexual orientation is not only abhorrent; it's scientifically and medically disproved. One only has to look at the recent research into the genetics and biology of siblings, and indeed twins, who identify as LGBTIQ to see that there is clear evidence that suggests that genes and biology have the major role to play in an individual's sexuality. I really think some of the arguments that are being proposed are not only spurious; they're nasty; they're small-minded. They do not really deal with reality and it's time to dispel them. There's no connection between marriage equality and Safe Schools programs and things like this. There's no relationship. We are voting to allow people who love each other to get married. I have been married, as I said, for 38 years, going on for 39 years. Why should I deny that to any couple who love each other? We just shouldn't. We cannot underestimate the harm that's been caused to individuals in the LGBTIQ community, who have had the nation discuss whether or not they are equal members of our society, and to the same-sex families and the children of these families, who've been told their families are unnatural and wrong. It's just not right. As a paediatrician, I have seen children from all different family make-ups. I can assure you that the only real thing that's important to children is that they are loved. In fact, it's the discrimination that we've seen, and continue to see, which is harmful to children, not that they have parents who are of the same sex.  Research conducted by many paediatric groups has confirmed that children raised in families with same-sex partners do as well emotionally, socially and educationally as children raised by heterosexual parents. The rubbish that's been said to the contrary is really enough to make me despair sometimes. Most of my child health colleagues have come out against the misinformation that's being circulated. Professor Frank Oberklaid, of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, the most revered developmental paediatrician in Australia, has continuously stated that it's essential that we recognise the potential that the debate that we've just had about marriage equality has to cause harm. We saw mental health organisations, AIDS organisations and LGBTIQ organisations being inundated by requests for mental health support throughout the postal survey, and we continue to deal with the targeted abuse that was put out by some people during this campaign. A number of organisations have been calling for this matter to be resolved in a far more efficient and effective manner in parliament. My own Australian Medical Association has come out in support of marriage equality. In fact, the President of the AMA, Dr Michael Gannon, stated:  There are ongoing, damaging effects of having a prolonged, divisive, public debate- about marriage equality- and the AMA urges the Australian Parliament to legislate for marriage equality to resolve this. Coming into this place last year, perhaps naively, I believed that the function of the members of this chamber was to make choices on behalf of those we represent. I think that the marriage equality survey really was a denial by this parliament of what it should be doing. What became clear to me throughout the process is that the current government is lacking leadership and backbone, but I'm not going to say anything more about this. I do not believe that this is an issue owned by the Labor Party or owned by the Liberal Party or National Party or by other parties. This is evidenced by the wonderful work of people like Dean Smith, Penny Wong, Louise Pratt, Trevor Evans, Trent Zimmerman, Tim Wilson, Julian Hill and, I think most of all, Warren Entsch. Thankfully, the Australian people have led in this debate, and they've called out loudly and clearly for equality. Today, and over the next day or so, we'll be making history and legislating for same-sex marriage equality. We will have a bill that deals with basic human rights. We will be giving rights to a community that for too long have had their rights as people, as Australians and as parents questioned. That has been very, very wrong.  I am very glad that we'll have marriage equality. It's long after time. I congratulate all those who've worked so hard for this to happen, but I am also sorry. I am sorry that we have put a whole lot of people through questioning of their sexuality, of their relationships and of their families. I think that has been a very bad thing. I don't think any political party is particularly to blame for that, but I do think the process could have been handled in a much better way. I look forward to having marriage equality in Australia and I will celebrate the fact. I'm glad to put my name to this debate, but I won't be happy until we have marriage equality. And I'll also be happy to see Trent Zimmerman stop smoking!"
48971,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Sarah Henderson,0,LP,Corangamite,3,"I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. This is a historic week in this parliament, and it is with considerable pride that I will be supporting this bill and voting yes. For thousands of Australians who are members of the LGBTI community and who support same-sex marriage, this is an incredible time in our nation's history. This week we expect to bring into law fundamental social change to the institution of marriage, which is valued by millions of Australians. I would argue this is one of the most important institutions in our society. Australians, by a significant majority, embraced and supported our government's marriage law postal survey. Nearly 62 percent of Australians voted yes, and in the Corangamite electorate, which I proudly represent, the 'yes' vote was even higher, at 72 percent.  There were also nearly five million Australians who voted against the introduction of same-sex marriage and who hold a traditional view of marriage, including on religious grounds, and it is imperative that these people and their views are also respected. Freedom of speech and freedom of religion are fundamental freedoms in a representative democracy such as ours. At every step of the way in this debate, year after year, I have worked hard to ensure that the views of every person I represent in the Corangamite electorate are acknowledged and respected. In June 2015, before the issue of marriage equality came before our party room and it was decided to take this question to the Australian people by way of a plebiscite, I confirmed that I supported both marriage equality and a free vote for coalition MPs. I made it clear that support for marriage equality is consistent with fundamental liberal values, which embrace freedom of the individual and stable long-term relationships. If two people love each other and wish to commit to a life together, they should have the option to be recognised equally under the law.  The bedrock of our society is family. To that end, I would like to reflect on the Prime Minister's speech in the second reading debate. His words resonated very much for me. He said: I have to say that I'm utterly unpersuaded by the proposition that my marriage to Lucy or indeed any marriage is undermined by two gay men or women setting up house down the road, whether it is called a marriage or not. Let's be honest with each other: the threat to traditional marriage is not from gay people; it is from a lack of loving commitment, whether it is found in the form of neglect, indifference, cruelty or adultery-to name just a few manifestations of that loveless desert in which too many marriages come to grief.  It is not always easy in life to find one's soulmate, the one person to whom one wishes to commit for the rest of his or her life. Many people who oppose same-sex marriage argued to me that I should support a same-sex civil union rather than marriage. But for me it was very important to point out that in our society and our country, as in most societies and countries around the world, there is no greater commitment between two people than marriage, and that is a commitment which gay and lesbian Australians should be entitled to make as much as Australians in a heterosexual relationship. While I spoke in favour of a free vote 2 years ago, I accepted and supported a plebiscite to give every Australian of voting age a chance to have his or her say. We made that commitment in 2015. We took it to the election last year. When the Labor Party, in an act of hypocrisy, blocked our plebiscite legislation, we found another way to take this question to the Australian people. I appreciate that some gay and lesbian Australians were hurt and anxious about this process. I also condemn all of the regrettable statements which were made, from both the 'yes' and the 'no' cases. But, on the whole, our government's postal survey was overwhelmingly embraced by Australians, with positivity and optimism and with an incredible participation rate of 80 percent.  There is a long and complex history to the issue of same-sex marriage in the Australian parliament. Over six years when Labor was in power, led by two prime ministers who did not support a change in the law, this vexed question remained unresolved. Today, however, I don't propose to infuse my contribution with political slings and arrows, other than to say that I congratulate the Prime Minister of Australia, the first Australian Prime Minister to consistently support the legalisation of same-sex marriage. There were many other champions in this parliament but perhaps none more so than the member for Leichhardt, the crocodile-hunting, slightly wild man from Far North Queensland, an unlikely, on the face of it, champion of change, who for a decade or more, in the face of enormous opposition, has fought to introduce marriage equality. I congratulate the 'yes' campaign and the many hundreds of people who championed the right of gay and lesbian Australians to marry. In particular, I wish to acknowledge Rodney Croome, who has fought discrimination against the LGBTI community for many, many years, from the very early days when homosexuality was considered a heinous crime. And, locally, in my community, there was one person who stood out. Her name is Sharyn Faulkner, the mother of two sons, one gay and one straight. She has fought tirelessly to ensure that both her sons have the same right to marry, and, as a mother and as a campaigner, she is a pretty incredible woman.  The passing of this act should not give rise to any discrimination against gay and lesbian Australians. The LGBTI community has endured too much discrimination in the past, too many injustices and too much hurt and isolation. These terrible days in our great nation, which so values and upholds freedom and equality, must come to an end. I also believe that charities must be protected, marriage celebrants must be free to marry whom they choose, and freedom of speech and freedom of religion must be protected. I am concerned that the bill before the House does not adequately provide for these protections. That is why I may support one or more amendments to this bill, provided these amendments do not overreach, and I reserve my right accordingly, depending on how these amendments are drafted. I am comforted by the decision to establish the Ruddock committee into religious freedom, a decision made by our government, which will have broad scope to address many of these fundamental issues and concerns.  For reasons that I'm not at liberty to or I don't wish to discuss or raise at the moment, this is something that means very much to my own family, this change in the law, and I also want to mention someone, a very dear friend of mine who died very tragically a number of months ago. His name was John Parker. I don't want to say too much about John. He was gay and he had a lot of struggles-he was a very dear friend. When I can say more about it I will, but I want to talk to his family first. He really wanted to see this change in the law. And his loss-I haven't been able to write anything about it or speak about it because it's been horrific. I'm sorry I'm crying. But his loss has been terrible. He was a dear friend from the age of 12, one of my closest friends. In one of the last conversations I had with him, he just said to me, 'Hendo, just bloody well get on with it, okay.' And I say to JP, my dear beloved friend who I miss so dearly: JP, that is what we are doing. I commend the bill to the House. "
48972,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Mark Butler,1,ALP,Port Adelaide,1,"It's an absolute pleasure to rise in support of this bill, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, as a longtime supporter of marriage equality and as someone who voted in favour of what I will call the Jones bill in 2012. It is wonderful to be really at the point of this reform finally becoming a reality in Australia. This is an important reform in terms of civil rights, and it's important to bear in mind that, as the member for Corangamite has beautifully outlined, any advance in civil rights is not an abstract piece of paper; it's a panoply of very human stories, as we've just heard.  Before the 2012 vote, members who were here were encouraged to go and have a conversation with their community about the attitude that should be taken to the private member's bill that was before the parliament then, which, as I said, I supported at the time. When I spoke in favour of that bill in 2012, I read out an email that is still moving to me from a grandmother in the Port Adelaide electorate. She wrote to me before the debate in the parliament and said: 'When my grandchildren ask me why I can love my partner and not be married, it's painful to explain that I live in a country that does not let people like me get married. After 33 years, three children and two grandchildren, I think I can attest to love, commitment and the hard slog of long-term relationship that goes side by side with the beautiful family moments.' On the day before the vote back in 2012, more than five years ago, Molly in my electorate emailed me and said: 'As with so many families, we cannot wait to celebrate at our beautiful daughter's wedding ceremony. With votes such as yours, it's getting closer and closer.' Unfortunately, Molly, her family and so many families around Australia have had to wait more than five years since that last vote that we had in 2012, but we are, it would appear, finally here at a point where within 24 hours this parliament will have passed this reform, I very much hope.  This is, as a number of speakers have pointed out, really just the latest chapter in a series of legal and social reforms around homosexuality that have occurred over the last five decades, and in each of those chapters I'm so proud that the Labor Party has played a leading role. That goes back to the decision 45 years ago of the South Australian Premier, Don Dunstan, from my state, to enact the first piece of legislation to decriminalise homosexuality, and to the legislation that the first Rudd government put in place to remove discrimination from dozens and dozens of pieces of Commonwealth legislation against same-sex couples. Labor has played a leading role. And this chapter has been, as almost all of them have been-certainly the significant chapters have been-a long and hard road, most obviously, it goes without saying, for LGBTIQ Australians and for their families. Like so many of those very important social reforms that we've seen over the decades in Australia, the Labor Party's journey in this question has both reflected and also helped to lead the change in opinion that we've seen over recent years in the broader Australian community. In saying that-as a Labor Party person, obviously I focus on the role of the Labor Party-I think it's important that we also recognise that it was a very long, hard road within the Labor Party. I know, as a longtime activist in the Labor Party involved in these debates, that for many in the community-for some in the chamber today, I imagine-that was too slow. We were too slow. I know that there were points along the way in that journey where we broke the hearts of many people who wanted and expected the Labor Party to be braver and to be quicker than we were. I remember having to report back on negotiations at, for example, the 2009 national conference-negotiations that the member for Grayndler and I had been involved in around these questions-to a room of very, very angry national conference delegates and Rainbow Labor members. There was a lot of anger and there were a lot of tears, and I think we need to be honest about that as the Labor Party.  The negotiations that I was a part of in the 2011 national conference were hard too, but in those intervening two years there had been a substantial shift, both in the broader community and in the Labor Party. The adoption of marriage equality as a Labor Party policy at the 2011 national conference was a huge achievement. It was not only an achievement for leaders like Penny Wong but also, importantly, an achievement for hundreds and hundreds of party members, particularly members of Rainbow Labor, who had been working so hard within the party to make that change. It profoundly shifted the national debate; that decision at the conference in 2011 profoundly shifted the national debate.  For me, I've always been clear on what the legal position should be for same-sex couples on this question. It should be civil marriage as of legal, inalienable right, and it should be religious marriage with choice for religious institutions. In the lead-in to the national conference in 2011, I wrote as much in an op-ed published in The Sydney Morning Herald. I said that Australia should adopt the model that had recently been adopted by the New York state and the United Kingdom, where there was a legal, inalienable right to civil marriage for same-sex couples but also the right of churches and other religious institutions to choose not to conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies if that was their preference. I see that position broadly adopted in this bill, which is a very significant reason why I support it. Other than that carve out, the key work of this bill is to provide that legal, inalienable right to civil marriage. In doing that, we should be honest that marriage in Australia today is overwhelmingly a civil institution, and that is a relatively recent phenomenon. When I became an adult in the late 1980s, 60 percent of marriage ceremonies were conducted by religious celebrants. In 1999, the majority shifted to civil ceremonies, and since then there has been a precipitous drop in market share, if you like, by religious celebrants or of religious ceremonies. When I wrote that op-ed in 2011, only six years ago, religious ceremonies still accounted for about one-third of all marriage ceremonies in Australia-about 33 percent. In Queensland and WA, by then, it had already dropped to less than 30 percent. I looked at the ABS data on marriages and divorces that was only released last week for 2016. The market share of religious ceremonies is down to 23.6 percent of all marriages in Australia. In WA and Queensland, religious ceremonies now account for less than 20 percent of marriages conducted in those two states. In what is now a predominantly civil institution, the institution of marriage, it is only proper that civil standards of equality before the law are applied by this parliament.  I've always supported, as I've said, the right for religious institutions, for churches, effectively, to opt out of conducting same-sex ceremonies, but I do not support any of the other amendments that have been proposed by the member for Warringah or foreshadowed by other members of the conservatives. I have to say that I'm somewhat struck by the irony of the 'big C' conservatives on the other side of this House now arguing to enshrine such rights in law. My first campaign in politics was the 1988 referendum, where the Labor government proposed to extend freedom of religion in this country. I remember, at the time, John Howard engaged in a vigorous and, I think, cynical campaign-because his political fortunes where not going particularly well-led by the new member for Flinders Peter Reith to knock that campaign off. As a result, we did not extend the right or freedom of religion, because of a decision in a campaign led by John Howard, reflecting the decision that the equivalent parties took in 1944 in the post-war reconstruction and democratic rights referendum of that year as well.  It is somewhat ironic that you've got the 'big C' conservatives on that side of the parliament now deciding that they do support enshrining rights such as the freedom of religion into legislation or the Constitution because, as I think the newly engaged member for Goldstein has pointed out, that has not been the traditional position of those opposite, as I found in the first campaign that I was involved in as a relatively young Labor activist in the late 1908s. But, as the Leader of the Opposition has said on behalf of Labor, we support the Ruddock panel process. Importantly, it includes Frank Brennan, a great Australian, who pointed to the 1988 referendum, and the failure to give a bipartisan level of support to the extension of the freedom of religion, as being 'a lost opportunity'. I think there is some irony in this.  It is also important to say that I didn't support the plebiscite and the postal survey for a range of reasons, only one of which was the extraordinary cost involved. As a matter of principle, I just do not support the idea of submitting questions of civil rights for groups in our community to a plebiscite of the entire community. As a matter of principle, it is the wrong way for this parliament to work. But also, as a practical question, what we warned would happen obviously did happen. There was enormous division and enormous hurt caused by this plebiscite and postal survey. Although I think what we're about to do in the next 24 hours is a wonderful thing, that should not be taken as any sort of endorsement of the process that has been followed over the last couple of months. But, having said that, the passage of this bill will be a great moment for our nation. It is a moment that should be the cause of substantial pride for a lot of people who have worked so hard for many years, or, in the case of some young activists, for a relatively short period of time. All of that work has just been utterly wonderful. I want to thank LGBTIQ Australians for their patience and for their forbearance, not just through the recent process but for the years and years that we have been arguing for this important reform. I want to thank rainbow families across Australia for their forbearance over that entire period of time. I particularly want to thank the rainbow family I'm closest to-my dear friend Penny, Sophie, Alexandra and Hannah-who have had the spotlight put on their family like no other. I think they've shown enormous dignity through this process, as a symbol for so many thousands and thousands of rainbow families across the country.  I've talked about the role of Rainbow Labor within our political party. I think they've been fantastic. The work they did to change our party's position and lead the change in the broader community has been utterly wonderful. A range of other organisations have been equally wonderful-AME, PFLAG, the 'yes' campaign and many, many others. It is very risky to shout out individuals in this sort of long-term reform, but I'm going to do it anyway. Rodney Croome has already been mentioned. He has been in the gallery during parts of this debate. Rodney's courage, his resolve, has been an inspiration to me and to many others in this chamber and around Australia for many, many years-along with his relatively recent sidekick, Shelley Argent, who I do still see in the chamber, who stomps the halls of this parliament, relentlessly making the case to parliamentarians. Their work has been an utter inspiration. To all of the volunteers who worked so hard on this campaign, you have done a great thing for our country. Thank you. "
48973,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Kevin Hogan,1,Nats,Page,4,"A number of years ago, when I was a political aspirant and wasn't in this place, I was asked about my attitude towards same-sex marriage. I said back then, which was obviously a while ago, that I thought the decision should be made by the Australian people, whether it be through a plebiscite or a referendum. I think the result of what has happened through this process validates that. I always said I would be comfortable in supporting that, and voting yes, if that was the way the Australian public chose. I have always thought that, because what we're doing here is a massive cultural shift. We are changing an institution and the definition of an institution that has been around for thousands of years. It's not something like putting the tax rate up or down or changing other policy, which we do in here on a daily basis-and then another parliament or another government may well reverse or change those decisions. The decision we are making in this parliament on this postal survey that we did is a big cultural shift that will not be reversed. Therefore, I thought going to the Australian public to do this was always a good idea.  Some activists and some advocates for this in the community disagreed with me vehemently on this through the process, and I certainly had sympathy for where they were coming from. People within the LGBTIQ community said, 'We will be discriminated against.' I do not know what that discrimination would feel like, given I am not in their shoes, so I certainly had sympathy for the fact that they thought this process would be damaging. While there were certainly isolated cases of that, I have spoken to a few of them since then, and they felt that the process went exceptionally well. One reason is obviously the turnout of the Australian population in this postal survey, at 80 percent. Obviously the result was definitive. One person came up to me a day or two after the result and said, 'Kevin, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually pleased, even though we've had debates and arguments about it through the process, that this is the way it happened, because this is validating it more than if we'd just had a conscience vote in parliament by 150 MPs, when there would still be, for many, a lot of conjecture about whether it was the right decision or not.' Even those who voted no are very conscious that the Australian people and the Australian public have validated this, as I said, not only in the numbers that came out but also in the numbers that said yes.  I congratulate the advocates, including those in the LGBTIQ community who have been mentioned before, who have been putting this case, in some cases, for decades. There are a couple in my community. Again, I don't really want to pick people out, but I will mention Cam Hogan, who's no relation. Cam was the person I was referring to before, who was very concerned about this process and how it would work. I will also mention Marie Reilly, who also did a lot of work. I'd like to mention my office manager, Peter Weekes. Peter has been a gay rights advocate for decades. He was very passionate about this cause and did a lot of work in our local community to get people to enrol to vote and in pushing the 'yes' case. There were obviously people before them. People over many decades, if not longer, have been pushing reforms. Young gay people now are going to receive the rewards of that and live lives that people before them would only have dreamed about.  I said many years ago that I would support this. I will be voting yes for this legislation. We have had a discussion and a debate about the religious freedoms and the religious protections about that, and I think that's very important. I too applaud the appointment of Philip Ruddock and the others who will look at this, because I think they will do this in a very considered, measured way. Again, as has been mentioned, there were millions of people who voted no and who are struggling with this, and we said, very importantly, that we need to protect the religious institutions. We have separation of state, church and judiciary in our country, and it's very important that we value churches and religious freedoms and that they can protect their values and what they believe.  I will just finish by saying that my mind shifted on this a number of years ago, and it was actually in a discussion with a friend of mine who is a Catholic priest. I was having dinner with him and my wife. I consider him a friend. He's an exceptionally articulate and intelligent man. On theology and philosophy I very much listen to him. I remember the Italian restaurant we were in. The discussion of same-sex marriage came up, and I wasn't there at that stage in my own mind. He said, 'Kevin, I can live with state-sanctioned same-sex marriage as a priest as long as you protect us.' I thought, 'Well, if he can get there, why can't I?' He was the first person who really spoke to me in that way, and I then had to really question my own beliefs and my own values. I was brought up in a very Catholic family. I went to church every Sunday until a relatively senior age; I haven't been doing it as much as I should, but my upbringing was very traditional. But when a friend of mine who was a Catholic priest was sitting across from me at the table saying, 'Kevin, I can get there in my mind,' I thought I needed to question my own principles and values on this. I think we've come to a good place. The Australian people have done us proud by embracing this in a way that I think was very open and was done relatively well. Again, I look forward to passing this legislation but, at the same time, very much protecting the religious institutions and freedoms in our country. "
48974,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,David Feeney,1,ALP,Batman,1,"I'm proud to rise in the House today to support the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. This bill will allow two people the freedom to marry in Australia regardless of their sex or gender. The bill also recognises foreign same-sex marriages in Australia. The requirements for a legally valid marriage otherwise remain the same under the Marriage Act. This is a bill that is faithful to the fundamental values of the Labor Party-that is, the resolve to remove discrimination wherever we find it, whether that discrimination be based on race, religion, wealth, gender or sexuality.  As a senator for Victoria, I spoke in the other place on 20 September 2012 in support of what was then the Marriage Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2012. On that occasion I articulated why I, as a Catholic brought up and schooled in the Catholic traditions, earnestly believed that marriage equality was completely consistent with Christian faith. For this reason, I was particularly pleased to see that, according to recent surveys, some 67 percent of Australian Catholics voted yes in the recent marriage equality survey. I was one of them. Moreover, while I support Australia's protection of religious freedoms, I have never believed that religious doctrine should ever be enshrined in our nation's laws. Only one-third of marriages today are solemnised in a religious ceremony. The notion that marriage belongs to the church cannot be justified.  I believe that placing a restriction on marriage so that it can only occur between a man and a woman is not relevant to our modern and-for so many-secular society. What is important is that, when people find a loving relationship, their fellow Australians afford them dignity and respect for that relationship. I supported marriage equality in the Senate in 2012. In a letter to Australian Marriage Equality in August 2013, I said I looked forward to voting for marriage equality in that year, 2013. Now we have arrived at the last sitting week of 2017. I should make this point, as it's been made on several occasions: the achievement of marriage equality as Labor policy in 2011 was a significant landmark for my movement and, I think, for the debate in Australia. As so many others have done, I would like to single out the work of Rainbow Labor in particular. This group worked tirelessly and bravely to change the opinions and the stance of the Australian Labor Party. In so doing, I think it again demonstrated the power of progressive social movements through and within the Labor Party and again demonstrated that the national conference of the great Australian Labor Party is the crucible for real change in this country. The vote could have happened, of course, in August of this year, but the coalition, as we know, resolved to pursue a postal survey rather than instead moving immediately to a free vote in this parliament. This is, in my view, a terrible abrogation of leadership by the Prime Minister, and I fear it was the fruit of a factional fix to paper over divisions within the Liberal party room rather than a legitimate public policy position. As a consequence, instead of letting parliamentarians carry out their proper role as legislators, the Prime Minister presented Australians with a non-binding opinion poll and a $122 million bill. Worse, the Prime Minister resolved that LGBTIQ Australians should be subjected to a unique process of lawmaking, one that applies to no other group of Australians.  On 24 August, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Attorney-General joined me at a marriage equality roundtable I hosted in the electorate of Batman. We were joined by many parents, carers and family members from rainbow families across my electorate. The stories they shared with us about their lives, their experience of discrimination, the hurtful things their children were hearing and their anxiety about a new, painful, lower standard of public and private debate were very literally heart wrenching. Our message to those loving families was as clear as our duty: Labor would stand with our LGBTIQ friends and neighbours. Following that roundtable, a group of concerned mums and dads in my community came together to discuss how we could demonstrate our support for rainbow families and the LGBTIQ community during this marriage equality debate that the survey engendered. Together they organised the Darebin Family Fun Day, a day of fun for all families celebrating and supporting local rainbow families. Hundreds attended and my family and I were among them. The will of my community is clear and it is strong. We want marriage equality now.  Throughout the survey, the Labor Party and local Labor Party branches worked tirelessly to promote a 'yes' vote, to make people aware of the issues in the debate and to make sure that everyone in my community was cognisant of the fact that there was a survey and they must participate in it, and indeed there was an enrolment drive, which realised an astonishing 5,000 new enrollees, most of them young, underlining the fact that this was a cause that particularly captured the emotion and the passion of young Australians. A great part of the credit for the result, of course, belongs to them and their participation. On 15 November, the result of the postal survey affirmed this truth. A resounding majority of Batman voted yes to marriage equality, with a very high participation rate. Some 83.9 percent of voters in Batman responded to the postal survey, with 71.2 percent responding with a 'yes' vote. This was a great success for the 'yes' campaign and I would like to thank the many people involved locally and across the community. I would like to thank every local shop and small business that put up a 'yes' sign in their shop window. I would like to thank the nearly 5,000 local residents, mostly young, who enrolled to participate in this survey.  It is long past time for equality for LGBTIQ Australians. It is long past time for us tell children of same-sex couples that their families will now be recognised as equal to any other. It is long past time for atonement for the inaction of the past. It is long past time for this parliament to affirm what many of us have long known, that the union of LGBTIQ couples is deserving of the same dignity and the same respect that is given to other couples under our law. It is long past time for the parliament to implement the will of the people. My vote will be for loving couples who have long committed to each other but are held to be inferior under our current marriage law. My vote will be for the advancement of equality. Same-sex couples are not asking for any more, or indeed any less, than anyone else in this country. They are asking for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and this parliament can and should and must grant them that right. Passing the marriage amendment bill in 2017 to remove discrimination and allow two individuals, regardless of sex, sexuality and gender identity, the opportunity to marry will create what the Constitution of our country intends, and that is a separation of church and state. The bill is fair and it strikes a balance, ensuring legal acceptance for everyone's beliefs and their values. The people have said yes. The Senate has said yes. Now it is time for us to get it done. I will be very proud indeed to vote for this bill, and I commend the bill to the House. "
48975,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Ken Wyatt,1,LP,Hasluck,2,"I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. When I first entered parliament I met an incredible character-Warren Entsch, the member for Leichhardt. He was a whip at the time, and one conversation I had with him was on his vision and commitment to the LGBTI community. He talked at length about why he was championing the cause, and during that discussion my own faith and belief in marriage was challenged by Warren, not a in a negative way but in the context of saying if two people love each other, why should we stand in their way? Why should we allow our own personal judgements to prevent them considering the context of marriage the same as other Australians do? Those discussions continued with him, along with many others, over a period of time throughout my first term in this House. I do want to acknowledge both the member for Leichhardt and Senator Dean Smith for the work that they have done. There are many others on both sides of the chamber, and I don't wish to make this a political issue by acknowledging people by party so I will do so by referring to the capacity of those individuals to think outside of confined definitions, to seriously consider the relationships that people enter into.  When we meet someone and we fall in love with them, we fall in love with them because of the endearing qualities that they have. Those qualities mean so much in very endearing terms. Over a period of time I have heard from a number of people from the LGBTI community who I have interfaced with over the years in my roles in education and in health-in health more than anywhere else. I think back to a staff member of mine. I was talking one day about the prosecution of a name that I saw in the paper, Toonen, in Tasmania. I made a comment about Toonen v Australia-the outcome of that case and the implications that it had. It was a recognition that somebody chose to live a different life to what was considered the norm. Out of that he said, 'That was my brother.' We talked about the challenges that he went through. I followed the career of Don Dunstan's, partly because of his own political persuasion but also because of his gutsiness at the time in being very open and frank about the relationship that he had and his own attraction to same-sex marriage.  I have been lobbied by many people in the period that I have been in the parliament. I want to acknowledge Rodney Croome, who I didn't always see eye to eye with, and I also want to acknowledge Shelley Argent. Both of them are very articulate in putting forward the views of the people that they represent. They talked about, and brought to me, people who wanted to have their view expressed. That was important in influencing and making us as members of this parliament think about a section of our community who were being isolated to some extent but certainly treated differently.  As I reflected on what I was going to say tonight, my mind turned to a program called MindMatters in secondary schools. I went to the launch of MindMatters in approximately 2000, and they talked about the resilience of young students in high schools. They talked about the construct of the program and, at the end of it, I sat and I asked the question: 'How did you include Indigenous people, culturally and linguistically diverse groups and LGBTI people?' There was this incredible two minutes of silence before somebody on the panel stood up and said, 'We didn't.' In that process, MindMatters decided to produce a component called CommunityMatters. I had the incredible privilege of meeting a young woman who we did a vignette on because we were needing to reflect a perspective of a young person who was challenged by the construct of being attracted to the same sex while her peers were putting pressure on her to be like them. When that vignette was done and they showed her mother, because we needed to have her permission, her mother said, 'I now understand my daughter.' As a parent she said, 'I now will support her because I became aware of what it was that my daughter was grappling with.' I heard a colleague from the other side last night talk about her journey and for the first time being allowed to express her emotions for another in a way that she had not been able to. Right at the beginning of the debate, I was interviewed by Patricia Karvelas. She asked me a question at the end. She said she wanted to talk to me about constitutional recognition and, in the typical fashion of journalists, she said, 'Ken, what is your view? What is your position on same-sex marriage?' I said to her at the time, 'I have a personal position, based on my faith, but if my electorate supports through a plebiscite a position that is a majority reflection of the 'yes' vote, I will honour their voice. I will commit to making sure that their views are reflected through my representation as the member for Hasluck.' When I look at the results I see that 79 percent of people voted and 62 percent supported the 'yes' campaign. I haven't deviated from that, and I will honour their desire, because when we get those opportunities to reflect our constituents in this place it is a privilege.  The other thing that was important was the basis of the focus on equality. When you belong to a minority group, as I have, and still do, one of the challenges you have is bringing forth your view as a member of a minority group who seek changes. We're often challenged by having to convince the majority that we need a change to reflect our aspirations, our desires, our considerations and our future. Certainly in this campaign we had a very organised group of people committed to those who were in same-sex relationships and who desired to have marriage. They brought together the public of Australia to focus on the aspiration of love and the opportunity to join in marriage. When you're conflicted, you think about their position and your own commitment to what you believe are your values and your obligations to yourself as an individual. But we also have to consider in that context, too, that we have an obligation to consider diversity and to respect difference and those qualities that are inherently important to every one of us within the communities and society in which we live. If I take the human rights based approach-the principles of nondiscrimination, of the availability and accessibility of the same things that all other Australians have-there is an acceptance that as individuals and as couples we are not always the same but the quality of those relationships and that love doesn't differ. It is something that we need to respect, but the universality of the legislation in supporting the rights of fellow Australians to something that they desire is important for this House to consider.  I always was of the view that I would want to seek the views of broader Australian society, not to disaggregate a commitment by this House to addressing the issue of same-sex marriage but to have an important issue like this owned by Australians. It is no different to the argument that I've put forward in respect of Constitutional recognition, on which I have frequently said that I will respect the views of fellow Australians in supporting a significant change within a societal construct. I have listened to the various debates and enjoin myself with many of the comments that have been expressed on both sides of this chamber, and I acknowledge the concerns that individuals have in respect of protecting the rights of those who voted no. I want to share some of the comments from my electorate. I will honour and work towards reflecting their views as well, because there is a percentage that voted no. I quote: like so many other NO voters, I voted this way because of a variety of deeply held beliefs, including the belief that marriage can only be between a man and a woman.  I had churches within my electorate that said to me, 'If you are representing us, then protect us.' Equally, I had others who said: 'We have no issue. We believe in the love of God for those made in his unique image, and on that basis we would like you to support a yes vote if it is predominant.' Another wrote: As your constituent, one of the many who have spoken up by voting NO, I ask that you and your parliamentary colleagues now support legislation to permanently enshrine these freedoms into law, regardless of any changes to the Marriage Act. While I note that there are protections there, I would certainly hope that we will address those protections within a raft of other legislation that we have that holds us to account against the issues of discrimination. The Turnbull government has delivered on its pre-election promise to give Australian people a say on whether the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry. Thanks to the Australian marriage law postal survey, my electorate of Hasluck have had their say. As Hasluck's representative in federal parliament, I have always said over the course of this debate, as I said earlier, that I would need to respect the majority of the votes of those I represent. Legislation has been introduced into the parliament to change the Marriage Act, and many of my constituents have voiced their concerns about protections of free speech, religious freedoms and honouring the intent of the postal survey. I share some of those concerns and welcome the decision by cabinet to establish a panel of eminent people, led by Philip Ruddock, who I hold in high regard and who I know will consider the adequacy of the legislative religious protections, not only in this act but in the other acts that are designed to protect Australians in respect of views and positions that they hold. The announcement of this decision demonstrates the strong leadership and commitment of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to protect religious freedom. The challenge of our democracy is to acknowledge the right we have to express our personal position on many issues.  Your views were expressed to me and I am truly grateful for the overwhelming volume of feedback and differing perspectives I have received. Please be assured that I reflect those views in the government party room on your behalf. Equally, I will continue to fight for protections of Australians, as I did in my stance on 18C to protect the rights of those who would have been disadvantaged by the construct of freedom of speech. I will be equally resolute to defend the voice of those who voted no, the services who take the contrary position, because the beauty of our country is that we are given an incredible privilege to express views and opinions but also our rights and equally our obligations as Australians to make sure that the harmonious fibre of our community and our society prevails and that respect is always two-way in the way in which we consider each other. So I commend the bill to the House and I thank you for the opportunity of speaking on this matter."
48976,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Josh Wilson,1,ALP,Fremantle,1,"I am very glad to support this bill, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, because I believe, quite simply, that all Australians should be equal before the law, because I know that discrimination on the basis of sexuality is wrong, because I know that happiness shared is not happiness diluted, and because I know that giving all couples the right to choose the stability and commitment that marriage represents for some people-not everyone-is the right thing to do. In delivering marriage equality, which we do this week, Australia will move along the path of greater inclusion, equality, respect and love. While the change that we make this week is certainly not before time, there is no doubt that it is time.  The electorate I represent showed strong support for marriage equality. I was rapt to participate in a 'Fremantle Says Yes' rally underneath the iconic container rainbow. I did that in collaboration with the City of Fremantle, which adopted a strong advocacy position in support of marriage equality, initiated by my friend and former council colleague Jeff McDonald. That rally on a beautiful Freo evening, high above the port, was attended by nearly 1,000 people, representatives of many groups. We were fortunate to be addressed that evening by Tiernan Brady, who did so much for the campaign here in Australia and played a leading role in the successful campaign in Ireland. We also heard from my friend and colleague Senator Louise Pratt, who has been an inspirational and indefatigable warrior in the cause of equality and social justice for LGBTIQ people and for all people who face discrimination or disadvantage. Our final speaker that night was Emma Gibbens, who did such a fantastic job coordinating the 'yes' campaign in Western Australia. But the most amazing attendees were all the people who showed up in solidarity and celebration of the principles of equality and inclusion, in support of the change we make this week and in support of love. There was a woman at the rally who travelled from the Perth Hills to attend. She said to me afterwards it was the first time she could remember feeling genuinely welcomed and accepted for who she was within a large community gathering. That was particularly meaningful to her because the rainbow sign that she had hung on her fence as part of the marriage equality campaign had been defaced the day before.  More than 82,000 people in Fremantle took part in the postal survey, which was approximately 80 percent of eligible participants. The highest rate of participation was from those aged 70 to 74. On that basis, 70 percent of participants supported marriage equality. Fremantle said yes. It said yes loudly, joyously and overwhelmingly. We have reached the point here, this week, that we could have reached earlier and more easily. I have no doubt that the process of the postal survey was wrong, and we shouldn't glide over that. There was no need and there was no justification for a non-binding, non-compulsory postal survey which came with a hefty price tag of close to $100 million. We have heard, frankly, a lot of waffle in this place this week about tradition and conservative values and the Westminster system, but there is no way you can reconcile a non-binding, non-compulsory postal survey with the tradition of legislative process in this place. Even in relation to this particular piece of law, there was no such process when former Prime Minister John Howard changed the Marriage Act previously. There was no such process on any number of significant changes that could just as easily be characterised as matters of conscience. I know there are a lot of people in my community and around Australia who were made to feel that their right to feel included and that their right to be equal before the law was being made subject to a strange and badly-fashioned popularity contest. But in the end, the people of Australia made it good. They made a bad process good by their participation, engagement and campaigning. That was uplifting to see, and we in this place owe them a debt of gratitude for that. No meaningful change occurs unanimously. No person has their seat in this place unanimously. Very few have it on the basis of 70 percent support, which was the result in Freo. No government has ever been formed with 133 seats out of 150 in the House of Representatives, yet 133 electorates around Australia supported the change we are making this week to deliver marriage equality. Every electorate in Western Australia, every single one of the 16 electorates, voted in favour of marriage equality. Let's not be mistaken about the strength of feeling, the strength of reasoning and the strength of principle behind this outcome. Let's go forward now, together, with a change that takes from nobody, a reform that simply makes our society more equal and a shift that allows all Australians to choose marriage if that's right for them.  I say in welcoming the extension of that right-the right to choose-for people to live in loving, committed relationships with or without children, that those relationships are not any less worthy or any less deserving of respect if they don't happen to be marriages. My wife and I married in 2006 or 2007-I will get in trouble now for saying that!-and we had been together for 11 years. We were in our second house; we had three children. We were married by a civil celebrant. We were very glad to celebrate our relationship with our friends and family, and we were fortunate enough to have that choice. That is what we deliver through this bill to people right across Australia, and it's right that they have that choice, but it doesn't mean, with all of the talk about what marriage means and delivers, that people who don't choose to marry live in relationships that are any less equal. As we make and celebrate this reform, let's remember what has gone before and what there still is to be done. Delivering marriage equality builds on the hugely important reforms that occurred under the previous Labor government. It removed discriminatory terms and rules that worked to exclude same-sex couples from 84 different pieces of Commonwealth legislation.  Let's also be clear that marriage equality, in itself, will not magically bring an end to other kinds of discrimination against LGBTIQ Australians. The wider pursuit of respect, the cherishing of diversity and the rejection of stereotypes are a matter of culture and character, and we've still got a long way to go on that path with respect to LGBTIQ Australians, as we do with respect to other sections of our community, particularly Indigenous Australians. But saying that doesn't take away from the significance of this reform; it simply means that we have more to do. Important struggles can only be won through leadership, and to some degree the big struggles create the leaders that they require. I think it's also fair to say that the experience of disadvantage and discrimination can fuel the fire that burns as resistance to injustice, inequality and exclusion. It's never been surprising to me that some people I have been influenced by in my involvement with Labor politics and progressive politics also have the perspective that comes with being a member of the LGBTIQ community: people like my very good and longtime Fremantle friend Justin Di Lollo, who bears some responsibility for having switched me on to the Labor Party in the early 1980s in Fremantle; people like Susan Brennan; people like Andrew Sullivan; people like Felix Pal. It's not surprising to me that some of the leaders in progressive politics around this country-I'm going to talk about some in Western Australia-who fight for the rights of working people, who fight for social justice and who stand up for those who have least and need strong voices are also people who have that perspective, that resilience, that deep humanity and courage. They are people like Carolyn Smith, Stephen Dawson and, of course, my colleague from the other place Senator Louise Pratt.  There are many Labor parliamentarians who have worked on this cause for many years, but, in addition to Louise Pratt, I want to of course recognise the unstinting, essential, inspiring work of Senator Penny Wong. I also mention the work of my colleagues in this place the member for Whitlam and the member for Griffith, among others. I would like to recognise and pay tribute to the determined, reasoned, courteous and honourable way that this particular bill was created and negotiated by my colleague from Western Australia Senator Dean Smith.  As I said at the outset, I believe the change we are about to make is driven by a simple matter of the principle that people should be equal before the law. I say to the LGBTIQ community in Fremantle: I'm sorry that this has taken so long. I'm sorry for the extent to which you have been put through the wringer. I thank you for your strength of purpose, for your fierce commitment to seeing this done, for the way that you have lived the great, binding values of love, equality and inclusion. We owe you a debt of gratitude for leading us into the light. Marriage equality is not a gift or concession to LGBTIQ Australians, their families, their friends, their colleagues and their neighbours. To our families, our colleagues, our friends, our neighbours, it is the right of LGBTIQ Australians. They have fought for it; they have won it. In fact, it's their gift to all of Australia, to all of us together, because it makes our nation a fairer place and a more cohesive, respectful and loving community. "
48977,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Damian Drum,1,Nats,Murray,4,"Firstly, I would like to thank Australians for having such a well-run, calm, respectful survey into this issue of changing the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples to marry. In the election of 2016 I was asked repeatedly how I would vote on the issue of same-sex marriage, and I said then that, whilst I would personally vote in favour of same-sex marriage, I would ultimately respect the views of the nation. In the seat of Murray, during the same-sex marriage survey, the seat of Murray had 57.6 percent vote yes and 42.4 percent vote no. Of all people registered in the electorate, just under 80 percent took the opportunity to partake in the survey. The electorate of Murray voted about five percent less for the 'yes' vote than the Australian nation did as a whole.  I disagree with the previous member; I think the process was by every measure a stunning success. We had over 80 percent of Australians actually have their say on this important issue. Most people were thinking we'd be doing well if 60 percent of Australians were to go to the trouble of casting their vote, but we had over 80 percent of Australians take part in this process. They have given us-they have given all Australians-an undoubted mandate to get on now with changing the Marriage Act. What this has meant is that the nearly five million people who voted no now realise they are in a minority. Whilst they might not agree with changing the Marriage Act, they now understand that the parliamentarians have been given a mandate by the majority of Australians. They will be considerably more accepting of these changes than if 150 politicians had simply gone off to Canberra and changed the Marriage Act on their own. Whilst I am really happy for same-sex couples to now be able to marry-I'm genuinely happy-I am also hopeful that this parliament will be able to ensure that we protect the religious freedoms of religious ministers and celebrants so that they are not forced to take part in a ceremony contrary to their religious beliefs. Certainly, nobody should ever lose their job for simply stating their opinions, even if those opinions are politically incorrect. I will be making a short contribution to the second reading debate tonight, but I am really hoping that this parliament can find a balance that will show the nearly five million people who voted no that their opinions and their views are truly respected. At the same time, we need to ensure that the nearly eight million people who voted yes have their will granted to them. Australians clearly voted yes, and we need to honour that vote. I see both sides of this debate, but I also believe very clearly that humans are either born gay or they are born straight. I therefore don't want to be part of any discrimination where people are not allowed certain rights simply because of how they were born. Hopefully this parliament can find the balance that best reflects the views of the Australian nation-that is, to change the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples to marry and, at the same time, put in place protections for those in the community that have very strong religious views so that we do not replace one type of discrimination with another. "
48978,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Milton Dick,1,ALP,Oxley,2,"Like many of my Labor colleagues and those opposite, I rise to speak in support of the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 and, in doing so, in support of marriage equality. Australia is a proud, progressive country, and has long led the world when it comes to human rights and protection from discrimination in our society. Our nation's rich egalitarian spirit is a product of our history and a product of our forebears. Indeed, in 1902 Australia was the very first country in the world to give women the right to vote in federal elections and also the right to be elected to parliament on a national basis. Why? Because in Australia we stand for equality. In 1962, the Commonwealth Electoral Act provided that Indigenous Australians should have the right to enrol and vote at federal elections. Why? Because in Australia we stand for equality. Today we have the chance to again stand for equality by legislating for marriage equality-a once-in-a-generation chance to again show that Australia is a proud and progressive country that treats everybody equally before the law and treats everyone equally when it comes to love.  All of us in this place have an enormous responsibility to prove that everyone is equal when it comes to the law and to love. The journey to reach this point has been a long one and it has not been an easy one for the LGBTIQ community in Australia. The first bill introduced to parliament to legislate marriage equality occurred over 10 years ago, and we have since seen 22 failed attempts. This includes multiple coalition governments who have sought to prevent or delay this rightful course of action. The latest of these manoeuvres was the postal plebiscite to tell us what we already knew-that Australians are overwhelmingly in favour of marriage equality. It was a waste of $100 million to appease the right-wing conservatives in a desperate last-ditch attempt to prevent the inevitable.  Whilst, yes, the voter turnout was very strong, and, yes, over 61 percent of Australians voted in favour of marriage equality, the lack of leadership by this weak Prime Minister meant that hundreds and thousands of gay and lesbian Australians had to endure months of speculation about the legitimacy of their relationships and sexuality. Now we see the Prime Minister and some of those opposite trumpet their contribution as some sort of achievement. They should be ashamed, not proud. It was not an achievement for the Brisbane woman who had rocks thrown at her home whilst the vandals yelled homophobic slurs. It wasn't an achievement for the 14-year-old who received death threats from a schoolfriend's dad over supporting same-sex marriage. It wasn't an achievement that saw posters plastered across our cities with slogans such as 'A vote for gay marriage is a vote for child abuse'. There should be no sense of achievement from those opposite. They should be ashamed, not proud. What we should have been doing is what we are doing right now by having this debate on the floor of the people's parliament. If only the Prime Minister had had the backbone in the first place, we would not have subjected LGBTIQ Australians to those atrocities, and this could have happened a long time ago. So, no, Prime Minister: when you said:  It will be forever to the credit of the coalition that this momentous social change occurred ... you are misplaced. You are out of line and you are insensitive to the enormous damage this plebiscite did to thousands of LGBTIQ Australians. What was intriguing about the postal plebiscite, however, was those who prided themselves on championing so-called free speech being the first to condemn and to attempt to shut down those voices they did not agree with-those who supported marriage equality. This included-to the bewilderment of the Australian public-the member for Warringah suggesting the censorship of American rapper Macklemore at the NRL Grand Final and banning the playing of 'Same Love', an extraordinary act coming from someone saying that the freedom of speech is quite a sacred principle. Nonetheless, Australians turned out in force to support marriage equality, including in my own electorate of Oxley, where 60.3 percent of locals voted in support to almost match the national figure of 61.6 percent. I was also proud to see my home state of Queensland vote in support, with 60.7 percent of people returning their ballot forms marked 'yes'. Like most other electorates, it was the youngest and oldest in my local community with the highest representation in the figures. This included several locals at a retirement village near my house in Durack who made a point of stopping me at a visit recently to inform me of their support for marriage equality. They told me that the time had come to pass this into law so that all Australians could be treated equally. That's not to mention the hundreds and hundreds of emails my office has received that were sent from far and wide by people to show their support. These came from not only LGBTIQ Australians but from heterosexual Australians, young Australians and old Australians to show their overwhelming support. This includes one from Jennifer in the Centenary Suburbs of my electorate, who said: 'I believe the time has come to treat us all equally. This is one of the most important issues of our time and it is time to stand up.'  I want to focus on the effort in my home state of Queensland, which was led by so many committed activists from Labor over so many years. I'm proud tonight to recognise the strong leadership of Queensland Premier Anastasia Palaszczuk; Deputy Premier Jackie Trad; my good friend and long-term marriage equality campaigner, the mighty Grace Grace; Shannon Fentiman; Attorney-General Yvette D'Ath and her groundbreaking work as an equality campaigner; and my brother, Cameron Dick, a minister in the Queensland government. I'm proud of his work and achievements in the portfolio of Attorney-General, as Minister for Education and as health minister, and his support for the LGBTIQ community. He is someone who has always stood up on the side of equality.  Evan Moorhead, Jon Persley and Rainbow Labor in Queensland worked alongside so many grassroots activists in Queensland to deliver this change. There were people like Shelley Argent, who is in the gallery this evening. Thank you, Shelley, for your commitment to your family and to so many families here in Australia. I also want to thank members of this place on the other side-people like Trevor Evans, my colleague from Queensland, Trent Zimmerman, Tim Wilson, Warren Entsch and, of course, Senator Dean Smith. To my own friends, who have shared their own painful stories with me, I know what this decision means. For many of my best friends-my dear friend Tom Kenny, Ben Mulcahy, Tony Rickards, Nino Lalic and Mat Cooper-I know what this all means. When you get married, you can ask me to be the best MC at your wedding! And so it is.  It's incumbent on us, the members of this House, to make it a reality. We cannot afford any further delays that would see this process drawn out any further. In 2015, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Maribyrnong, introduced his own private member's bill in an attempt to legislate for marriage equality. Speaking on the bill at the time, he said: We cannot assume this change is inevitable. We cannot imagine it will just happen. We, the 44th Parliament, have to step up to rise to the moment. Prior to and since that time, the Leader of the Opposition and Labor have been leaders in calling for marriage equality to become a reality. This also includes my other Labor colleagues, such as the member for Sydney in her relentless campaigning and advocacy, the member for Isaacs in his continued passionate work to ensure this parliament would see a bill for marriage equality, and of course, as many have said before, the amazing Senator Penny Wong, who has been at the forefront of this debate and this cause for many, many years-because that's what the Labor Party does. We show leadership when others won't. We stand up for what's right when others won't. We stand up for the fair go when others won't. And we stand for equality when others won't. We stand for an inclusive and accepting Australia where your relationship is not judged by the gender of the person that you love but simply by love. It's time to get this done. I commend this bill to the House. "
48979,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Julie Owens,0,ALP,Parramatta,1,"On 15 November, Australians voted overwhelmingly to change the law to allow same-sex couples to marry. It was not so in the electorate of Parramatta. My electorate voted in almost a mirror image of the national vote: 61.1 percent of those who voted voted no. It's fair to say that on 16 November, the next morning, there were very few people in Parramatta feeling particularly good about the result. My LGBTIQ community was feeling more than a bit bruised about the process as a whole and about the local result, and some were wondering aloud with me if they should have reached out more to the broader community. The 'yes' voters were a bit shocked by the strength of the 'no' vote, and the 'no' voters had lost the national vote and were feeling more than a little shocked themselves. No-one was feeling very good on 16 November in Parramatta, in spite of the fact that, for many LGBTIQ people all around the country and their families, this was a momentous day. To make matters worse, the media and the commentators seemed to think they had a right to make all sorts of assumptions about my community and who voted how and why and to lay the blame with various groups, without really understanding just how complex we are in Western Sydney. There isn't one community there; there are many. They really weren't great days and, for me, I felt quite depressed at the split in my community and that so many people were feeling that their views were no longer the majority view.  But we are a diverse community in Parramatta and we're a great one, and we get along and have done for decades. We are a success story and I want to talk directly to my extraordinary community tonight. To the LGBTIQ community and their friends, I am so pleased for you. I know it's been a really long journey for many of you. I know many of you remember the days when your love was illegal and I know that the last few months have dredged up some awful memories for some of you. What the parliament does this week will not remove all discrimination, but it's a huge step. I wish you well, and I wish for a wedding boom in Parramatta and I know we'll have one!  But my character at the moment, unfortunately for you guys, is to want to spend time with the people who are hurting the most. So I want to spend quite a bit of time tonight speaking to those who voted no and who have been rocked by the national result. Those of you in the LGBTIQ community know what it is to be a minority and to feel undervalued, but many people in my community are feeling that for the first time and it doesn't serve any of us well to leave those people behind. We have a job now to pull together and find a place for all of us in our community. I have met and talked with many people in my community about this over several years. In fact, I've opened my office on several weekends in a row and had queues of people all day on Saturday coming in specifically to talk to me about this issue. So I am well aware of how my community feels about this and how split they are across the community. I went out before the last election and told my community that I would vote yes. I told them that because I wanted to give them the opportunity to take that into account in deciding whether to vote for me. As promised, I am going to vote yes tomorrow. I know for many of you that will be more than disappointing. I know that many of you have a profound religious belief that marriage is an institution and that it can only be between a man and a woman. But there are others whose reasons were different. I met some who voted no because they were tired of the debate and they'd had enough-they just voted no. There were others for whom the idea was a little alien to their world experience, but they're okay with the national result, even though they voted no personally. But, from my perspective, something unpleasant happened in my community during the postal survey process. It's as if the whole process turned this into a matter of winners and losers. I wouldn't be a member of parliament if I didn't believe that in most cases we can find space for reasonable people of good faith to live alongside each other on their own terms. That is our task now.  For those who are most concerned about religious freedom, I said before the election that I would vote yes. But I also said that I would not vote yes if I believed religious freedom would be harmed. I still hold this position. But from hours of asking advice, of talking to experts, of reading and of talking to religious leaders in my community, I am absolutely convinced that such freedoms are not at risk. I would very much like to explain why I believe that, in an attempt to take some in my community from the position that they now hold, of fearing the future, to a place that I consider to be a more realistic view of what the future holds. I know that people are concerned and worried and, in some cases, afraid of what the future holds. But we didn't go through this whole process-a process hurtful to many-over recent years and months to replace one group of people who felt left out, the LGBTI community, with another one, a group of people of strong religious faith who feel, either rightly or wrongly, that their right to practise the most important thing in their life is under threat. If this whole thing-the survey and this Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017-is about respecting who people are, then we must respect all. It is now our job, as members of this place and community representatives, to walk away from the winner and loser situation and find a place for all. The 'no' voters in electorates that had majority votes are no less important than the 'no' voters in mine. We must now work through the issues of concern and either demonstrate that the fears are unfounded, and that religious freedom is protected, or respond to deficiencies in the law and find security for those of strong religious belief and a right to live without discrimination on the basis of sexuality or on the basis of religious belief.  I don't foresee the problems in terms of religious freedoms that many see. I believe our religious freedoms are protected and I believe this bill actually strengthens those protections. I believe we've been doing it for decades. Definitions of marriage are already different between church and state. In many cases there are religious groups that don't believe in contraception, divorce or living together before marriage, and we all coexist successfully and will continue to do so. The freedoms that now allow churches to define marriage on their own terms in a way that is different from secular law will continue to exist. I know that there are people in my community who are profoundly wounded, and we must work through these issues. We can't leave people behind on this.  I'm going to talk about three issues: the right of churches and religious organisations to define marriage on their terms; the right of religious organisations, particularly religious schools, to teach their view of marriage; and the protection of charities from loss of DGR status. Then I will talk about where we go from here-in particular, the review of religious freedom that's going to be chaired by the Hon. Philip Ruddock and what process we can go through in my own electorate to look at key areas of concern and work out together whether there actually is something to be afraid of here. In terms of the law, religious freedom has two faces: the right to hold a view and the right to express, or manifest, a view. The first one is universal; you can hold a view. In dictatorial countries you can't hold a view-you get killed for that-but in Australia you can. But when the manifestation of that view bumps up against another citizen, that is where antidiscrimination law cuts in. There are very real exemptions for religious organisations and schools, but if you are a layman, a motel owner, for example, who holds a religious view that people should not live together before marriage, you cannot refuse to rent a room to an unmarried couple on religious grounds. That would bump up against antidiscrimination law. You can hold the view, you can express it as part of public debate, you can argue against laws-the Fair Work Act protects you from being sacked for holding that view as a layman-but you can't discriminate as a layman.  But the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, which defines all those rules, provides religious exemptions in the act that already cover churches, religious organisations and religious schools. Section 37 already allows churches and religious organisations to employ, train or:  ... any other act or practice of a body established for religious purposes, being an act or practice that conforms to the doctrines, ... Churches can define what marriage is to them now-whether it's between a man and a woman, whether it's for life with no divorce, whether it's only people of the church's faith-because the law allows them to do that, and nothing in this bill will do anything other than strengthen that. There was a case recently of a church that cancelled the wedding of a couple because the bride supported marriage equality, and the church believed that showed that she didn't have an understanding of the true meaning of marriage. That's fine; that's the church's business. It's entirely the church's business, and most of us in this place would stand up here and fight for the right for the church to make that judgement. That is a matter for the church to define marriage in their terms. They do it now, and there is nothing in this bill that will change it. In fact, the Dean Smith bill strengthens that. It provides protection for ministers of religion in explicit and extensive terms; there is specific additional strengthening of those protections. It also provides protections for civil celebrants who have a religious belief. It allows a new category of marriage celebrant called a 'religious marriage celebrant'. It also provides further protection for religious bodies, including that a body established for religious purposes-which, by the way, includes schools-may refuse to make a facility available or to provide goods or services for the purposes of the solemnisation of a marriage et cetera or for purposes reasonably incidental to the solemnisation of a marriage et cetera. So it strengthens-it strengthens!-the current protection. When it comes to religious schools, they can teach according to the beliefs of their church now. They'll still be able to do so after this amendment to the Marriage Act has passed. Schools can discriminate in employment practices now. Section 38 of the Sex Discrimination Act specifically gives an exemption to religious schools. When it comes to the curriculum, there is no requirement for any particular curriculum in religious schools. That's a matter entirely for the school. State and federal governments and education departments do not define what is taught in religious schools, and the changes to the Marriage Act will not change that. It will have no impact on what children are taught in religious schools. I'm just going to say that again, because I know a lot of people in my community have heard the stories that are circulating that somehow this is going to change everything when it comes to schools: the passage of this legislation will not in any way prevent schools from establishing for religious purposes or from being able to teach according to their doctrine. Neither this bill nor any other existing Australian law requires any religious organisations to express or associate with or endorse a statement or opinion about marriage that is inconsistent with its doctrines, tenets or beliefs. In state schools, the minister for education has stated categorically that this change will have no impact on curriculum in state schools.  I know there is also a concern about charities, and there has been a fear campaign running out there that charities would lose their DGR tax deductable status if they expressed a view on marriage equality that is different from the definition of marriage included in this bill. I just want to say this: Senator Dean Smith is way ahead of you this on-not you, Deputy Speaker Claydon; those who believe that's a problem. He's written directly to both the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. In their responses, the respective commissioners confirmed that the amendments to the Marriage Act proposed in this bill will not affect a charity's charitable status or DGR status under Australian law. I've seen copies of those letters. The capacity for charities to engage in advocacy without endangering their charitable status was also confirmed in the High Court in the Aid/Watch decision. And if you think about it, there were charities that were advocating to retain the current Marriage Act, so they were already lobbying and working in various ways, and that was not a problem. Labor does not believe that anything in this bill makes it unlawful for people to hold and express their traditional views on marriage. People in organisations who continue to hold traditional views consistent with their religious convictions will not be discriminated against as a result of this bill.  The government has established an expert panel to conduct a review of legal protections for religious freedom in Australia, partly in response to the concern in the community, and I and Labor take that review very seriously. The panel will be chaired by Philip Ruddock and will include Australian Human Rights Commission President Rosalind Croucher, retired Federal Court judge Annabelle Bennett and Jesuit priest Frank Brennan. Labor welcomes the establishment of the expert panel and looks forward to engaging with the review as it completes its important work.  For those in my electorate, I will be in contact with you again very shortly to explain how you can participate in that review. If you have things you want to say, things you want to add or questions to ask, we will make sure that you have every opportunity to do that. I'll also be organising forums with experts in discrimination law, religious freedom law and education to work through the specifics of concerns that people in my community have. I want to reassure people out there who are worried that I'm not just leaving you out there. It doesn't serve anyone well when we have a section of our community that feels left out, ignored or undervalued because of their beliefs. I will work incredibly hard with you to make sure that your concerns, whatever they are, are addressed, either by finding out that they're not a problem or by working with the review to protect the freedoms that they value so greatly.  For many in my community, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 is a wonderful bill. Again, for those in the LGBTI community, congratulations. We will vote tomorrow. It's extremely likely that something you've worked on for decades and decades will finally come to fruition. Break out the champagne. This is your night. You've earned it; you've worked so hard. Congratulations."
48980,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Andrew Laming,1,LP,Bowman,2,"We are probably 24 hours away from a major shift in social policy in this country. It is very clear to me that, within this chamber and in my city, in my electorate and nationwide, there is a view that every couple deserves to marry. While there are unique and special elements to every bond-and certainly your own marriage is a very good example of that-all marriages deserve equal recognition and two adults should be able to do it. That broader definition will come into force as early as the coming days. Recognising love in its all forms must now be recognised by a mature nation that can make that shift. The world, this country and my electorate are better places with more love-as much love as we can muster-and states that recognise that love.  Of course, two people forming a serious bond with the right intentions deserve state recognition. History will remind us that Australia legislated the Marriage Act, which, up until now, has been the only way to have it officially recognised. So to broaden this definition of marriage was, by far, the most expeditious way to make sure that every Australian adult had an equal opportunity to have that relationship recognised, and setting up parallel institutions, civil unions and other options, while they've been toyed with, was not the best way to proceed. Marriage of course occupies a central if not a pre-eminent place in human history, but other permutations do not necessarily corrode that. Until now, as I've pointed out, solemnising those relationships could only be done through this very limited Marriage Act. That had two fundamental weaknesses. The first one was obvious: it was unfair for same-sex couples. But remember also that it forced non-religious marriages for couples who had no connection to any form of faith whatsoever. It doesn't make faith any stronger to make it the only avenue to officially recognising a relationship. Five or six years ago, I was the first MP in this place to defer the decision on same-sex marriage to my electorate. Back in 2012, I committed to undertaking an annual plebiscite-a postal plebiscite; a household survey-through Australia Post, with a free post return, and that process yielded a result every year. I undertook to adhere to that result every year and to keep repeating that plebiscite until there was a better version. I am delighted that last year that became a reality with a commitment to a nationwide plebiscite.  Whatever your views might have been on that methodology, there is one thing that is very certain-that is, we have today come to the point where we can look at a genuine change to the Marriage Act that potentially would not have occurred for years or for parliamentary terms as the Senate consistently found ways not to pass it into law. That has been avoided. In my electorate we have been holding plebiscites since 2012. We have allowed every household a say. We have promoted it through social media. We have built participation. We have had scrutineers from both sides and we have publicised the count. What we realised was that people don't mind having a say on this matter. Sure, it took me five or six attempts over five or six years, undertaking to repeat it every time. But over a quarter of my households had their say, and I had a reasonable read on the view of my city. Let it be known that the view of just under 50 percent was to say yes and the view of slightly more than 50 percent was to say no. That was because our participation rates were far lower than the $100 million affair that the ABS put together so professionally. But to criticise polls that were held in my electorate as not being realistic is like criticising the ABS survey because only 80 percent of people participated. The point is that everyone had the opportunity to participate if they thought this was an issue important enough for them to participate in.  Two years, two months and two days after the much celebrated Irish vote, Australia did an even better job. And just like the celebrations in the streets of Ireland, Australia saw exactly the same thing. We had exactly the same result as the Irish plebiscite, a 'yes' vote of around 62 percent, but we had an 80 percent participation rate, mostly down to, I think, Australia's general predilection for participating in votes when they come along. But no-one came near to forecasting that 80 percent participation prior to us actually carrying it out.  I am actually delighted that the Liberals crafted this methodology; that under a Liberal government we have seen these laws passed; that we have crafted commonsense amendments that many on the other side have taken seriously. But I am disappointed that the Labor Party have elected to vote as a bloc against those amendments. I respect their right to do it but I think we could have had a far more mature debate about those very valid concerns. It is a shame, isn't it, that we do have to dive into these detailed amendments? It is because 99 percent of Australians can accept the verdict and operate in a civil democracy and respect the views of others but we do have an incredibly tiny minority on both sides of this debate who will take this to the nth degree, who will explore every single legal loophole and push their view until they can possibly get it to court. That is very regrettable. We will never get rid of those extreme elements, but I thought the reflections from the previous speaker, the member for Parramatta, about those legal protections, particularly for religious freedoms, churches and not-for-profits was extremely well considered and I congratulate her on them.  I am going to spend about three minutes running through eight of those amendments. The first one is the primacy of the marriage between a man and a woman. While I accept that someone would hold that view if they were in that relationship, I do not think that writing different versions of marriage into law is in the public interest. We can each hold our views on marriage and the various configurations and the benefits of them. I think there is no gain for this nation and no external benefit whatsoever in defining multiple versions in the act. We have expressive rights which we are very concerned about, in order that they are currently adequately protected. There are states that in fact do not protect them, but I am not sure that this bill, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, is the right place to be protecting them. They should be protected in other legislation. Certainly if you do not like the protections in your state then it is up to you to vote out that state government and replace those laws. I don't think this bill is the place to be hanging every exemption for things such as expressive rights for a range of religious issues of which marriage is just one. I don't support amendments that insist on multiple definitions of marriage. I also recognise that many of these amendments are unlikely to pass. So many of our positions, if we do vote for amendments, will fundamentally be to send a signal to our electorates. It is hard to know if these expressive rights concerns are genuine, apocryphal or just theoretical. I accept that there are occasionally challenges under 18C, but in reality this is extremely infrequent. Nonetheless, I'm glad that the Hon. Philip Ruddock will look into these issues, and I signal my support for protecting expressive rights, though I'm not confident that it needs to occur in this legislation.  The third issue is religious and conscientious protections, particularly for military chaplains. If that chaplain is a religious member of a church, they should be able to continue to have that protection if they're not paid in the armed forces. The minute you take a public purse then you agree to operate under the laws of the land, not the laws of the church. If you're a paid military chaplain then you can answer to the Chief of the Defence Force and how the military wishes to operate. This is no place for MPs to be telling them how to do it. There is a clear religious exemption, and chaplains can seek that out. If that is not the view of the military, and you don't like it, you can cease being a chaplain in the military.  Likewise, with celebrants, I can respect the primacy of conscience. That point was very powerfully made by the member for Fairfax-conscience, believe it or not, probably trumps religion. But, alas, we live in a world where all sorts of bizarre views can be passed off as conscience. For that reason I cannot allow people to act freely from their conscience in circumstances like working as a celebrant in a commercial position or running any form of business that may encounter someone who's married in a configuration that they may not support. For that reason I'm also not terribly in favour of some sort of register of religious celebrants. There is an exclusively religious exemption, which I think there is support for. If you're a celebrant, seek out that church and stick to your version of marriage in the church. That's why it is there. If you're a celebrant and you're taking commercial exchange for the services of marriage then you should do so under the law of the land, which now recognises all forms of marriage, as we see in the act. Celebrants are running a commercial enterprise. If they want to take on the religious exemptions, churches are there for them to link with. We're also somewhat concerned that business would discriminate for a whole host of reasons, including using same-sex marriage as a way of simply discriminating against people who are in same-sex relationships, or against homosexual Australians in general. Occasionally in life we may encounter these circumstances. But, again, this is not the place to be writing in the exemptions for those kinds of attitudes, which in many cases are bigoted ones. If you are in a commercial setting offering services to the nation, the law already makes it very clear that you will not select people by a whole range of what we refer to as 'protected attributes', and the form of your marriage should be an attribute that does not allow that kind of discrimination. You may not like something about a customer; sometimes you may have to do what you don't like doing. But the degree of hurt in doing that is not sufficient to demand exemptions under legislation.  Now we move to schools. Again, I have great concerns, not with Safe Schools in general but with how it is applied. In Queensland it is not a part of the curriculum but it is a resource made available to teachers to use when they want, and parents are not allowed to know that they are using it. That is a completely unsatisfactory circumstance, but I do not support the moral right of removing children simply because you think that some other form of marriage is going to be taught at school. That is a dangerous precedent, and we need a far more balanced approach. Obviously, if you don't like the school, that might be one reason to remove your child. If you are absolutely adherent to religious definitions of marriage, you seek out the school that teaches it. But you cannot move into a public school with publicly funded workers and be selecting when your child sits in class and when they don't. To be honest, for your child to listen to different versions of marriage is probably a public good.  Lastly, we have two very similar amendments from two of my colleagues about associational freedom. I agree completely that faith based organisations should be protected. Most of them already are, but there are genuine concerns that that could change in the future, and there is a desire for stronger protections. This is not the bill for those stronger protections. I support stronger protections; I'm not convinced this bill is the place to do it. Similarly, that would be the stripping of charitable status from organisations, as we've seen overseas-also extremely disappointing and extremely regrettable. But this bill is not the place for those exemptions, and it is something that will be considered very early in the new year.  This is a very, very important bill. I'm the only MP in this place who represents exclusively one city. The city of Redland, on the coast of Moreton Bay, voted slightly more strongly than the Queensland and the national average in favour of same-sex marriage. Regardless of my personal view, which I've never expressed on this issue, in 2011, as I said, I committed to following the verdict and the guidance of my people. I'm delighted that over the years more and more MPs have come to do the same. If you chose not to follow your people, as an MP, I respect that also, but the decision of Redland city has been made. I'm glad that it concurs with the view of the nation, and I look forward to passing this legislation in the coming days."
48981,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Brendan O'Connor,1,ALP,Gorton,2,"I rise to support the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 and oppose the amendment. I'd like to acknowledge the contributions made since I've been in the chamber. The member for Parramatta and the member for Bowman made very persuasive, well-informed and considered contributions to this debate. I believe this debate is very important. It's a momentous week for the LGBTIQ community. It's a momentous and historic week for this country, and it's overdue. It is time we remove discrimination and ensure marriage equality becomes the law of the land.  Before I get into the substance of the debate, I want to acknowledge the efforts of members opposite-indeed, some Liberal senators, including Senator Smith. I'd like to also pay tribute to all the members and senators who were involved in the culmination of the bill that was debated in the other place and is now being debated here. I believe that there was a great effort by the authors of this bill to take into account the concerns that were expressed by people in relation to religious freedom and other matters, and I think that's important. My electorate does support this change; however, I do accept and acknowledge that there was a very significant proportion of constituents in my electorate that did not support the survey. I accept, also, that the survey was successful in this sense: an overwhelming number of Australians participated, even though it was voluntary. And I support the result. However, I still believe that there was some harm done. People were affected by that debate. I don't support plebiscitary democracy. I believe in parliamentary democracy. There was no reason to have that survey, and there were constituents of my electorate that were adversely affected by the debate.  I received a letter from a young gay man who had not disclosed his sexuality to his family, and he indicated to me that the impact of the survey on him had been harsh, had been difficult. He wrote to me, and I responded to his letter, informing him that I was sympathetic to the difficulties he confronted as a result of the process. I also indicated to him that I was going to support the change to the law. In fact, in 2004, when the then Prime Minister John Howard sought to amend the Marriage Act, I said that I thought this change was some way off but would eventually happen. I do recall saying in 2004, at this dispatch box, that Australia had evolved. It wasn't that long ago-two generations ago-when people thought a mixed marriage was a Catholic marrying a Protestant. People had concerns about mixed-race marriages of heterosexuals. There were concerns about people living in heterosexual de facto relationships. But all of these things became increasingly more accepted, as they should be. The discrimination towards this community had to end. It's not just on the statute books; it's decades of discrimination. It is decades of violence towards many people in the LGBTIQ community and it has to stop. It won't just stop by us changing the law, but I do believe that the debate in this place will go a long way to preventing the intolerance, the bigotry and the hatred that has, unfortunately, been part of our history. The member for Grayndler referred to Paul O'Grady, New South Wales Labor's first openly gay member of parliament. He was courageous in his stance and in his campaign to see equality and justice for himself and for same-sex couples.  This has moved relatively quickly. I remember my relatives in Ireland informing me that they believed the referendum-that did have to take place in that country to change the constitution-was going to be successful. I have to say I was somewhat sceptical. It is a rural country, predominantly Catholic. I was sceptical that the result would be overwhelmingly supportive of marriage equality, and I was proven wrong. When I saw that result in Ireland, two things struck me. One was I didn't believe that Ireland would get there before Australia. The second was I realised that this would eventually happen in this country, despite those who sought to impede its progress. That's what's going to happen this week, and that's a wonderful thing. I also want to acknowledge a couple of other people, including, certainly, Senator Wong and Senator Pratt. I've mentioned the member for Grayndler and the member for Whitlam. There was an occasion just as recently as 2012 when we were debating this matter. I want to place this on the Hansard. I was away for that vote because of a very serious family illness, but I sent out a press release indicating that, if I had been present in this place on that occasion, I would have voted in favour of marriage equality on that day. It's important for us to understand how important this matter is to so many people in this country. I've been asked to acknowledge Leah Newman, who was the creative talent behind the 'yes' campaign. I'm happy to do that, to acknowledge the creative skills she brought to this campaign. And there are many others. There is no doubt that campaigning by the union movement assisted. Campaigning by people across this country for change led to such a positive result in this country. I accept that the member for Kennedy and I have different views on this. My point is that, overwhelmingly, Australians have said they want to see change happen. I believe this could have happened already. I don't believe everyone was motivated in a particularly healthy way to have the survey occur before this vote. Anyway, we're here now. This parliament gets to do what it should have done originally and earlier-that is, vote on a bill, which is how we do things in this contrary. Tomorrow, I believe, we will have the opportunity to vote for this change. I won't be supporting the amendments that have been moved by members in this place. I do support the bill as passed by the Senate, and I do believe that after this debate this vote will be a very welcome change to the law in this country. And it should be a day of joy and a day of celebration for people who have been discriminated against for too long. People who have loved each other have not been able to formalise that love. The state did not recognise that relationship in the way it should have, and I'm glad to say that we are very close now to seeing the end of that discrimination. That's a very good thing. After all the things that we've dealt with this week and indeed this year, it's nice to think that we'll end on a very positive note, one that will end discrimination. It's been an overdue change, and I pay tribute to all the campaigners throughout the country and indeed all the members and senators who support the change. "
48982,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Michael Danby,1,ALP,Melbourne Ports,1,"Along with the member for Grayndler, who's been here three years longer than I have, I've been on a long journey on this issue. We've been on a long journey. For nearly a decade we've stood up in this place supporting the rights of what was then called the gay community, now the LGBTI community, to not have discrimination enforced against them in Commonwealth legislation. Albo, as he's known, the member for Grayndler, and I had a lot of joy 10 years ago, in 2008, in successfully moving to remove discrimination against LGBTI taxpayers in Commonwealth legislation.  Let's look at this marriage equality survey in its international context. The first country to vote for marriage equality was the Netherlands, in 2001, and 26 other countries currently have marriage equality, including Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay. I agree with the previous speaker that Australia is a country of parliamentary democracy, not a democracy that believes that a referendum or a survey should be taken on every issue. We're here now. There is a famous film called The Rise And Rise of Michael Rimmer, which points to the dangers for democracy of imposing endless referendums on people. There were difficulties; there was hatefulness during this survey. But we got through it. Across the nation, 61.6 percent of people voted yes and 38.4 percent voted no. Participation was 79.6 percent-a very high response for a voluntary vote. The survey was mailed out to 16 million-plus Australians, and the ABS received 12,727,000 surveys back. Victoria received the second-highest result in the nation, behind the ACT, and the highest result of all states, with 64.9 percent of the population voting yes and 35 percent no. In Victoria three million people participated in the vote: 2,145,000 'yes' and 1,1661,000 'no'. Again, I think it was a bit of a surprise to observers that people over 50 were overwhelmingly supportive, with a 'yes' vote of more than 85 percent. In Melbourne Ports the result of the survey was astonishing. We achieved the third-highest result of all 150 electoral districts in the nation; 82 percent of eligible voters had their say. That's 86,000 of my constituents who participated, and 82 percent of those voted yes. Only the seats of Melbourne and Sydney had a higher return.  This has a history, of course. Every place has its own social history. Most recently we had the shadow Assistant Treasurer, the member for Brisbane and Terri Butler come and do a roundtable with the LGBTI community in my seat. Prior to that we had the shadow foreign minister, Senator Penny Wong, at one of the best attended public meetings that I've ever participated in in my electorate, with a great deal of enthusiasm for the Labor Party supporting positive change for marriage equality.  Melbourne Ports is, of course, where the Victorian pride march takes place, often with 11,000, 12,000 or 15,000 people-not quite as big as the Mardi Gras. It's the place where that great, iconic film Kenny was filmed. Some of the scenes at the pride march are inculcated in the Australian public's mind from that. The pride march began in 1996, but just 18 months before that Victoria Police detained 463 patrons of the gay nightclub Tasty, conducting public strip searches in one of Australia's most notorious instances of homophobic police brutality. That was 18 months prior to the beginning of the pride march in 1996 in Melbourne. So how much has Victoria changed? Victoria Police now participate in the pride march. Of course, Melbourne Ports is the location of the new Pride Centre that's going into Melbourne, the first of its kind in Australia. It is an initiative of my friend the member for Albert Park, Martin Foley, and the state Labor government. I have to pay particular tribute to its chair, Jude Munro, a great battler for equal rights who I've known since university. She's been part of my education on this. The Pride Centre aims to be one of the unique initiatives that celebrate, bolster and protect equality, diversity and inclusion in our electorate. We have a very big LGBTI community. Hopefully, this will pave new directions for its future and honour and celebrate the brave and sometimes difficult past of people in the LGBTI community. It will house the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives, the Victorian AIDS Council and that great beacon of equality JOY Radio 94.9 FM, the community radio station that describes itself as the only LGBTIQ radio station in Australia. The Pride Centre will host the Midsumma Festival, the Melbourne Queer Film Festival, Switchboard and Minus 18.  I've reflected in this debate on my personal journey on this subject. Following deliberations over the years and consultation with friends-particularly LGBTI community leaders, who I'll come to in a second, and faith leaders-my views have evolved on this subject. A lot of it's due to close friends in the LGBTQI community, who have had a profound effect on me, led by the formidable Macca of JOY FM radio, David McCarthy; Tass Mousaferiadis; the very important author on the issue of AIDS David Menadue; my dear former staff member Jamie Bingham; and my current staff member Josh Spiegel, who's worked very hard to see equality achieved on this issue.  I realise that everyone living on this earth, no matter what their gender, sexuality, race or faith, is God's work and everyone is equal. Everyone is entitled to the same rights and, of course, responsibilities. I decided in 2013, despite a campaign to put a bit of a fatwa on me, to announce my position with my trusted friends Macca and Tass Mousaferiadis on Australia's only community LGBTI radio station, JOY 94.9, as a demonstration of my commitment to equality, and I'm glad I did. It's brought us all to this day, a day that began a long time ago for me with seconding the member for Grayndler's motions, which we passed during the Rudd government, to remove discrimination in Commonwealth legislation against members of the community. I can think of no better way of concluding my remarks than quoting two brief paragraphs from the member for Grayndler's speech on this bill. He said:in supporting this legislation, we are saying that we are a tolerant nation, that we are a respectful nation and that we are a nation that is stronger because of our diversity. I think it is unfortunate that we will be one of the last advanced industrialised nations to recognise marriage equality when this legislation is passed. Nonetheless, catching up with the rest of the world is a good thing. I pay tribute to all those who did the hard yards-the really hard yards-to get us to this place.  He concluded by saying-and I absolutely agree with this: It is, however, of course, the Australian people who have led the parliament on this issue. I've been convinced for some time that a majority of Australians had shifted their view to favour marriage equality some time ago. I hear many Australians- I certainly hear them in Melbourne Ports too- say: 'I didn't used to support marriage equality. I do now.' I don't know of anyone who has said it to me the other way around- I have to echo Albo's sentiment-  who has changed their mind from 'yes' to 'no'. Australians want us to live and let live- It's the great Australian doctrine of the fair go- They've decided that as individuals we have no right to cast judgements on love as it is felt by others. I commend this bill, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, to the House. I commend the great day that's going to come for members of the LGBTI community who have been working so hard for so long on these issues and for the many people who've faced terrible discrimination in the past because of their sexuality. I think tomorrow will be a great victory for them and a very inclusive moment for Australia."
48983,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Chris Bowen,1,ALP,McMahon,2,"It is unusual in this House to dedicate a speech to anybody in particular, and I have never done that in my 13 years in this House. But I begin my remarks by dedicating what I am about to say to my friend Robert McMahon and his husband, Paul Stewart.  On 24 March 2002 I married the woman I love. At home I have my marriage certificate. At the top of the marriage certificate is the Australian coat of arms. It is not a religious symbol; it is not a symbol of faith; it is a symbol of our country. It tells me that it was my right as a citizen to marry the person I chose to. It is a construct of the state. It is regulated by this House. Of course, marriage is also a religious institution, and that tension has led to some tension in this debate, but it is a construct of the state. It is the right of all citizens to marry the person they love-except, at the moment, it is a right that is not given to all. Hence, I will be voting in favour of this legislation. This is the latest and perhaps the last in a very long march of legislative reform from the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the 1970s through all the reforms of governments of all persuasions, most notably the last eradication of discrimination during the Rudd government. I do want to deal with some matters head-on. As has been commented upon widely, my electorate voted 'no' in the recent survey. Some people were surprised by this. Some in the media appeared to be surprised by this. I was not. I fully knew and expected that to be the view of my community. If I dare say, I know my community well. That is actually why I took the conscious decision before the last election to make it clear that I would be voting in favour of marriage equality if I should get the opportunity to do so this term. I did so to seek a mandate, so that voters in my community were very clear: for those for whom this was an important issue, for those for whom it might determine their vote, if they strongly wanted somebody to vote against marriage equality they should not vote for me. I did that deliberately and consciously.  Having been here for 14 years, I hazard a guess that this is not the first time I have voted in a different way to what my community would want. I would put it to you that there is not a member of this House who serves for any period of time who could put their hand on their heart and say that if the community had a say they would vote the same way as I am in this House. Whether it is an economic matter, the introduction of the GST, or anything, there is no manner, I would suggest, in which a long-serving member of parliament could say, 'I always do exactly what my community wants.' The difference here is that we had a survey. This was a poor process. It was a process we never supported. It is a process we have not gone through for any other legislation. On no other legislation where we have dealt with discrimination, on no other legislation where we have dealt with people's rights, have we held a survey to first see what people think.  The people of my community who opposed this change are good people. I know them well. They are people, overwhelmingly, of faith. Having spent much time with them over the recent weeks and months, and indeed years, talking about this issue, I think I understand what drives their concerns. Many of them fear that their church will either immediately, or over a period of time, be forced to change-to change its thinking or its teachings. I have used the example of no-fault divorce many times in conversations. In the mid-1970s no-fault divorce was made legal in Australia. It was a controversial debate, not unlike this one. It was hard-fought. It was a conscience vote. Many people of faith argued that if the state allowed divorce more easily, so too would the church be forced to. History does not bear out that argument. It's now been legal in Australia for 40 or so years, and, certainly, while some churches may have chosen to liberalise their views on matters of divorce, the Catholic Church, for example, has not. It chooses not to recognise divorces, and there is no pressure on the church to change its teachings.  I would put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the House and to my community, as I have done, that the definition of marriage is a similar matter. It is our job in this House to ensure that the right to marry is available to all citizens. It is not our job to teach any church or religious institution what they shall believe and teach. We are not doing that tonight, and we will not do that when we pass this Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 tomorrow. There are specific protections in this bill. Clause 47(3) says, that 'a minister of religion may refuse to solemnise a marriage'. Clause 47B says that 'a body established for religious purposes may refuse to make a facility available, or to provide goods or services'. These are important protections and, of course, I don't believe it is the wish of any member or senator to force a religious institution to change. They will not be. I completely, however, respect and understand those concerns and I will continue to work with my community on those concerns. Bill Shorten has made it clear in his statements. He said: 'The Labor Party believes in religious freedom. We understand it is central to our democracy and our society.' And we do. But I also recognise the concerns in the community that, somehow, people of faith, people of religion, will be forced to change.  In many senses, we have not rushed this. Far from it. Nobody can say that Australia has dealt with this in a way that has not allowed people to think through the ramifications. We are the last English-speaking country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage-to introduce marriage equality. I do not believe that society has broken down in the other countries. That is not to minimise or belittle people's concerns, but it is simply not the case that societies have broken down in the countries that have legalised marriage equality.  This is an important and serious debate. As I said, I do not endorse the process that has got us this far. I do not endorse this process. I believe it is a poor process. I am not comfortable with the fact that the rights and liberties of members of our community who are same-sex attracted have had to go through the opinion poll which they just have, but the fact of the matter is that we are now here in this parliament finally doing our job. We will do our job tomorrow. When this bill passes tomorrow, as I believe it will, it will be an important day in the history of this House, but it will be a more important day in the history of our country. It will be a day in which finally those Australian citizens will no longer have to scurry overseas to marry, having to go to the trouble of leaving their community and their country, to exercise the same rights that I exercised in 2002 and that so many millions of Australians have exercised. They will be able to exercise it here, equally, with pride, with freedom and with love. It is time that that occur, and I am proud it will occur tomorrow."
48984,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Tony Zappia,1,ALP,Makin,2,"This debate on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 is not about the definition of marriage. That question was settled by the Australian people. It is, however, about how parliament enacts the will of the Australian people and the values that Australia projects into the future. There are three simple statements in the Australian Citizenship Pledge which beautifully encapsulate the values which, to date, have characterised Australian society. Those statements are:  ... whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect and whose laws I will uphold and obey. This legislation is a test of those values, and it embodies all of them. It is legislation which reflects the will of the Australian people and therefore goes to the first of the three principles being our belief in democracy. The legislation arises from a process in which all eligible Australians were given a vote. Almost 80 percent of eligible Australians participated in the process and, of those, 7.8 million voted yes, 4.8 million voted no and 3.2 million did not vote. The outcome was clear. In the Makin electorate, which I represent, 60.4 percent voted yes and 39.6 percent voted no. Those who argue that the 'yes' vote did not reach an absolute majority and, therefore, is not a mandate for change are in denial. To use a phrase borrowed from Abraham Lincoln: this legislation is of the people, by the people and for the people. That brings me to the second principle being 'whose rights and liberties I respect'. The word 'respect' does not mean acceptance or entitlement. It does, however, imply 'acknowledgement' and 'having regard to'. The question of rights and liberties is complex. It is a matter covered by numerous state and federal laws and international conventions which Australia is signatory to. I particularly note the reference by others who have spoken in this debate to article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In every society, the rights and liberties of one person inevitably impinge on the rights and liberties of others. Nevertheless, in a democracy, the greater good prevails, and that is determined by the majority view. The survey question that Australians responded to was about marriage. It was a simple question:  Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry? It did not contain questions about civil and religious rights. Those matters were not canvassed. That raises the questions about the rights and liberties of the over 4.8 million people who voted no. In this parliament, in a normal election, their votes would have been reflected in Senate representation, where proportional representation applies. Over the centuries, people have died because of their faith or their conscientious objections and beliefs. It still happens in the world today. Such is the faith and conviction of people that they will give up their lives for their beliefs, and no law will ever diminish their conviction. They, too, have rights that should be respected and protected. Both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition stated before and after the survey that protections would be provided, as also recommended by a parliamentary Senate select committee which carefully examined the questions about rights. There were clear commitments that I believe were well understood and accepted in good faith by the Australian people when they cast their votes. I also note that not all people who voted no did so because of religious objections. People also voted no because of conscientious or cultural convictions. Protecting rights and liberties is complex. Notwithstanding the complexities, commitments made by political leaders should be honoured.  The government has referred the question of protections to an expert panel headed by the Hon. Philip Ruddock and including Father Frank Brennan, Professor Rosalind Croucher, Fiona MacLeod and Annabelle Bennett. They are all eminent Australians with extensive legal and human rights expertise. Parliament should allow the panel to do its independent work and to present its recommendations. It may take some time, but it will ensure that the best possible outcome is achieved. I also note that the legislation before us already contains some religious protections. More protections may be needed to address matters of conscience or culture. Those are matters for the expert panel. Rushing through amendments now may result in more uncertainty and more court challenges rather than less. Yet I note that government members want to go in both directions-that is, set up an expert panel while simultaneously moving amendments which pre-empt and may even undermine the work of the panel. Few of our laws, if any, are so well written that they are always fair in all situations to all people. That is why matters regularly end up before the courts. That brings me to the third principle about the rule of law: once legislated, laws must be adhered to. It is therefore critical on such a difficult and complex matter that parliament enacts well-considered legislation, that the law is clear and that the legislation does not cause more problems than those which it seeks to resolve. The reference to the expert panel also highlights a much broader question about human rights. It is a question raised not only by this legislation but in association with other legislation of the Turnbull government, including, in recent times, refugee policy, national security legislation and social welfare laws. If Australia had a bill of rights or something similar, there might not be a need for the individual safeguards that we often see attached to other legislation and that are now being called for with respect to this legislation.  To sum up, marriage is a construct of society. It has existed for thousands of years, across cultures, religions and nations. It is not exclusively a religious construct. Society can therefore deconstruct or reconstruct the meaning of marriage to reflect the will of the people at any given time. I do not expect that passing this legislation will be the end of the matter. Indeed, it will likely lead to many other necessary changes to existing laws and possibly court interpretations of those changes. The will of the Australian people is nevertheless clear. Parliament should accept the will of Australians and change the law to allow people of the same sex to marry. The change will not just legalise the relationship but, importantly, bring widespread social recognition to same-sex relationships. Of greater consequence is that passing this legislation, combined with the 61.6 percent 'yes' vote, sends a strong message of acceptance by Australian society of people in same-sex relationships, regardless of whether they marry, as well as acceptance of all people who, to date, have been discriminated against because of their sexuality. I conclude with these remarks. On 10 May 1972, Dr George Duncan, a law lecturer at the University of Adelaide, drowned after being thrown into the river Torrens for being a homosexual. It was a dreadful, malicious act. His death became a turning point in homosexual law reform and in community acceptance of people regardless of their sexuality. The passage of this legislation, which I will vote in support of, will be an even more profound turning point for Australian society and what we value. "
48985,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Luke Gosling,1,ALP,Solomon,1,"I support the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. I voted yes in the voluntary postal survey. I love Darwin and Palmerston, and the electorate of Solomon that I represent. It is a welcoming, open and tolerant place. This marriage equality survey has mostly shown us at our best: civil and loving. As the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said in this House in this debate:  ... young Australians have shown Australia the sort of nation we want to see in the mirror-a generous, inclusive and tolerant Australia. Of the eligible voters in Solomon, 65.3 percent voted yes and 34.7 percent voted no. I saw this issue as a matter of equality and of human rights, of the rights of two people who love each other to marry. I respect the deeply held beliefs of those who voted no, of those who oppose marriage equality. Indeed, some members of my own Catholic Church congregation have told me they oppose marriage equality or same-sex marriage, and I respect their views. But this bill does not in any way change the importance and significance of marriage between a man and a woman or indeed of the sacrament of marriage. The church's laws will remain. This change is not in any way disrespectful of their loving and enduring marriages; instead, this change extends to other loving couples, same-sex couples, the same opportunity, the same respect, the same recognition for them to commit to each other through marriage. My friend, Dave Taylor, who I worked with at St Vincent De Paul Society, summed it up to me in this way:  I am excited to be on the verge of having the same rights as every other Australian with regards to marriage. It will be comforting to know that the sanctity of my 20 year partnership will finally be legally recognised. Glenn and I will soon be able to relax in the knowledge that our wishes will be honoured on our passing and that family members who haven't always been kind will no longer be able to override our wills and advanced care plans. We both work hard in and out of our jobs to give people a chance at a happy and productive life.  Passing this bill will also validate the lives of young Australians who will be able to live happy fulfilling lives knowing that their love and commitment to their partner is just as real and just as meaningful. We are not asking for special treatment or extra rights. We just want the same as everyone else. Thanks again for standing with us to make the difference. This reform has been painfully achieved for many same-sex couples through this unnecessary postal survey. It told us what we already knew-that most Australians support marriage equality, equality before the law. Despite the government saying it gave all Australians a chance to have their say, what it did was force many Australians to feel that they had to justify their sexuality, their relationships and indeed their existence. This was painful and ultimately unnecessary. The sense of anxiety and then relief at Hotel Oaks in Darwin, where I was with many of the yes supporters when the result was announced, was so palpable that it made me even more acutely aware of how anxious many of our LGBTQI brothers and sisters were about the outcome. To have their sexuality and their very humanity questioned, and their relationships the subject of public debate, was very painful for them. Up in Darwin, in my electorate, I want to acknowledge the leadership shown by the NT News in support of the 'yes' campaign. In Darwin and Palmerston the debate was mostly civil and respectful, but there were some hurtful actions and words and we need to acknowledge that. The debate about freedoms and protections will continue, and that is healthy in a democracy. But, having said that, there are already protections for religious freedoms and freedom of speech and I am worried about further harm being caused.  These amendments are mostly an attempt by those who have opposed equality every step of the way to frustrate it further. I personally will not vote to replace one form of discrimination with other forms of discrimination and will not be supporting amendments to this bill. Australians did not vote for the intent of these amendments-they voted for the straightforward question: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?' The 'no' campaign tried to convince people that the postal survey was about other things, such as the education of children or discrimination against those who believe in only marriage between men and women. Most Australians saw that the 'yes' campaign was about equality, about love and about human rights. To all of those who kept up the fight over the years, well done-I am so proud of you all. I want to mention just a few from my electorate: the Darwin Pride committee-Daniel Alderman, Jill Pope and James Emery; Jane Black and Rainbow Territory; the Yes Campaign NT convenor Pat Honan; the Palmerston 'yes' convener Seranna Shutt; Crystal Love and the Sistagirls of the Tiwi Islands; Tiana Hokins and her partner Mel; Sandra Smiles; Jo from Viva La Body; Jenny Smith; Sally Cotton; Rosemary Jacobs; Sara Scrutton; Throb Nightclub; the NT News; Darwin City Council; Palmerston City Council; and all of the other individuals, organisations and businesses that supported a respectful debate in the community.  Finally, I want to invite all couples to come on an adventure to the Top End of Australia-bring your family and friends. You'll have fun and you'll find Territorians wonderfully welcoming. The law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry, and I support the bill."
48986,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Nick Champion,1,ALP,Wakefield,4,"On Monday, 10 September 2012, I rose in this chamber to be one of the 42 to give a speech in favour of the then Jones bill for marriage equality, and I'm very glad that I did. I have to say that that debate felt very different from this debate. It felt different because the parliament was acting as it should-as the proper vehicle for changes in law and for advancements of people's rights. This debate should have taken place here and this law should have been enacted by this parliament-and should have been enacted by this parliament some time ago.  I'll talk a bit about the postal survey a little later on. I just want to reiterate the reasons why I voted in favour of marriage equality. I'll be plain, my speech in that debate wasn't the best one I had ever made but I think it was one of the most important. My sister had convinced me over some time, during many arguments over the kitchen table, to back in marriage equality. As we know, in 2012 electorally it was a different time and place and, once I had become convinced, holding fast to that conviction was an important thing to do. I think that is the way members of parliament should conduct themselves. You feel much better about yourself if you hold true to your convictions once you arrive at them. You do that over the course of deliberation, talking to constituents and to friends and family. But, in the end, a representative in this parliament should make up their own mind and should hold to it, no matter what the electoral consequences. Many members have referred to the postal ballot, and I want to talk mostly about the process, because the arguments have been made. This debate feels very different because we've had such an elongated debate. Most of the arguments to and fro have been made and have been done to death, but this debate should have been a conscience debate where you saw the best of members of parliament, where you saw the best speeches, where people listened to the speeches and where we didn't have empty galleries late at night. It should have been a debate full of passion and fury, and that passion and fury should not have been pushed into the community.  The parliament and representative democracy is a very old and important construct. In my speech in 2012, I referred to Edmund Burke, who was one of the founding architects of parliamentary democracy and modern conservatism, at least for the moment. The problem with the government's postal ballot was that it departed from that in such a dangerous way. If we can grant rights through referendum, what is to stop a government in the future from taking rights away through popular appeal? What is there to stop a desperate Prime Minister, say, appealing to public opinion about the death penalty or, conversely, about euthanasia or any one of the myriad other issues on which there are strong and passionate convictions in the community? It is a very dangerous thing that the government has done and has forced the country into. I am pleased that my party and the leader of my party campaigned so strongly in the referendum and helped to make this a success, and I thank all of those in the 'yes' campaign and all of the people who have been brave enough to stand up. They've been thanked many times in many speeches in this House.  Mr Pyne: Including me. Mr CHAMPION: Including the member for Sturt-he names himself, helpfully! But they should not have had to do that. That should have been a debate in this parliament. Most of all, you've got to thank the many family members, friends and community members over many years who've just had arguments around kitchen tables about what in the end is a pretty simple matter of equality. I've heard some members, including the member for Warringah, claim this as some sort of great moment. It's not a great moment. We were lucky to escape unscathed from a process which is fraught with danger and which undermines the operation of this parliament and has undermined the nature of this debate in this parliament. In particular, I've heard a few speeches and a few opinions about this issue of religious protections, and the government's had to put up a panel and a whole process to deal with it. If we had had a conscience debate at an appropriate time, there would have been time to consider this. Those matters could have gone to a committee in advance of a debate. Mr Pyne: It should have been done years ago.  Mr CHAMPION: The member for Sturt says, 'It should have been done years ago.' Well, who by and what for? People will treat it as if it's an esoteric point, but it's actually a critical point. If we have a situation where the executive or a Prime Minister irresponsibly-or they might believe they're acting responsibly-can appeal to the public in a very simple way on the notion of people's rights, that is a very dangerous precedent, I think. No matter how well it's worked out this time, it is a very dangerous precedent. I began my speech in 2012 quoting Edmund Burke, and I just want to do it again for those on the benches opposite. None of them are here at the moment-the member for Sturt is listening. I'll just remind him about Edmund Burke's famous speech to the electors of Bristol. Burke said that a representative owed his constituents: ... his unbiased opinion, his mature judgement, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgement; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.  This parliament and its representatives should not be swayed always by the simple matter of public opinions, of public opinion polls, of referenda, of postal ballots, because sometimes people's passions lead them to decisions they later regret, and sometimes simple notions have very counterproductive outcomes. So I hope in the future that these debates are dealt with by this parliament. Rights should be granted by this parliament, and if they have to be granted by the people then that should be done as part of a properly organised constitutional referendum. But I fear the government has set a precedent, and I hope it is a precedent that is not followed for a very long time. That said, I commend the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 to the House. I think it is a simple and kind measure that fellow Australians have finally granted gay and lesbian Australians. "
48987,2017-12-06,Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017,Second Reading,Bob Katter,1,KAP,Kennedy,4,"I'm glad I made a mistake and had to come down early so that I could hear the speeches, as I know now why I do not sit here and listen to speeches or question time. I have heard a conglomeration of snivelling drivel in my life, but there is not the slightest scintilla of intellectual content in any one of tonight's speeches.  I was rung up about this by the media. I had no idea what was going on-as usual, I was out there in the boondocks working away. He said, 'How are you going to vote on the gay marriage bill?' We had a little bit of an argument about the word 'gay'; we compromised and said 'same-sex marriage'. I said: 'What are you ringing me up about? What are we going to vote on? 'You can't be serious.' I've never been angry throughout this debate. I've found it extremely humorous, I've got to say. I said, 'Listen, mate, I don't know what it's like down south, but five percent of the population of Australia lives up here in North Queensland, and I don't think it's a great deal different to the rest of Australia, and no-one seems to get married up here. I can't remember the last time I found a couple getting married. So, mate, we can't get the heteros to marry-you've got absolutely no hope of getting that other mob to marry. But thanks for your call.' I thought it was funny. Whilst you people are all piously holding your hand over your hearts and saying, 'This is the best thing since Burke invented freedom and democracy,' down in the pub, in the real world, where I live and other people live, I walked into the pub and said, 'Bobby, I'm going bush, mate, before they make it compulsory,' and everyone roared laughing. But you don't live in that world. You don't live in that world where real people live. You live down here, where you listen to this incredible concoction of drivel.  Mr Champion: I grew up in the country. Mr KATTER: Well, you must've forgotten where you come from, mate. Let me continue. People accuse me of being anti-homosexual. You could read my book-which I might add is only $29 at all best-selling bookshops-An Incredible Race of People: a passionatehistory of Australia, which was the bestselling non-fiction work in the year it came out. I thank the Murdoch press-the only time I have ever thanked the Murdoch press-for publishing it. The head of COSBOA in Australia said: 'I always had you tagged as a redneck. The part of your book I loved most was about that homosexual friend of yours. It was very humorous.' I couldn't leave that out of the history of Australia, because we are a fun people. Have we lost our sense of humour completely in this country? I thought his humour deserved to be put in the history of Australia. While you were down here congratulating yourself on your popularity and winning the vote, I was at the coalface trying to get some votes up in the state election campaign. As a party-and I am not particularly proud of this-we started out our life with an advertisement, which was a most unpleasant advertisement. I agreed to it, so I will take the blame, along with everyone else. It established us as a very anti-homosexual party. There was no doubt about that. It was a first-time-out party-they took our name off us-but exit polling indicated that our vote was effectively 20.5 percent of the population of Queensland.  Coming back to this election: while you people were all running around advocating a 'yes' vote, the first polling booth came in in Queensland. It is the biggest polling booth in the state electorate. I was handing out how-to-vote cards. When the vote came in-and while I would like to attribute it to myself, I really don't think I had a great deal to do with it; this is a booth which is almost always won by the ALP-we got 720 votes, the ALP got 320 votes and the Liberals got 120 votes. I said, 'Would you please go back and get the correct figures,' because they were staggering. When I looked at the figures in all the electorates we ran in, they were between 19 and 25 percent-bracketed the four parties. One Nation and KP, where KP was running, were continuously achieving many more votes than the majors. But the way the preferences fall isn't always the way we want them to fall. The Labor Party in Queensland got one of its lowest votes since 1915. Ooh! That's something to be proud of, isn't it? You might say, 'The majority rules and the majority has it right, because this is a democracy.' I think it was back in year 2007 or 2011-I can't remember-when a bloke called Barabbas ran, and jeez he got a good vote! I can't help but point out the abolition of slavery! We won it on a trick. We Christians won it on a trick. It was the only way we could get the abolition of slavery through the parliament. As the writer of the book on liberty said: the tyranny of the majority in a democracy doesn't deliver justice, truth or rightness; it delivers the majority, which may not necessarily be very just.  The people advocating this proposition tonight, the LGBTIs, have maybe 60 years on their side. I have 3.5 million years of genetic programming on my side, because we human beings, they tell us, have been around for 3.5 million years. One thing that is absolutely certain is that we've all developed from heterosexual couples. That is one thing we know absolutely-up until the last 40 years, anyway. So, genetically, we are programmed that way. If you want to make a young lad between the age of nine or 10 and 15 go to school wearing a dress, you'll seriously mess with his head. If you are looking for reasons why, there are distinguishing factors of the 'incredible race of people', as I call us in my book-and I think we are. We always get there in the end, but, jeez, we run off the rails badly at times. If you analyse why this country continuously has the highest male juvenile suicide rates in the world-why is that?-there is something going wrong here. We have an extraordinary incidence of homosexual behaviour in Australia compared with other nations, and I think the people who have been speaking for this Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 would agree with me on that. The speaker before last said, 'Oh, it won't be held against you. There'll be no discrimination against people exercising their right to have a view on this conduct.' That's what he said. Well, go and ask the doctors who don't want to do abortions in hospitals how well they're travelling-those that you can find who would speak up on this issue. The Bishop of Tasmania was criminally prosecuted for saying, 'It's wrong to do that.' Well, doesn't he have a right to a moral position? I'm not going around advocating that people who advocate homosexual behaviour should be put in jail, but the opposition is advocating the opposite. The intolerance there is magnificent! I was in Sydney soon after my little party ran in that election-in which, as I said, we had an advertisement which I'm not particularly proud of-and a bloke in a flash, top-of-the-range Mercedes-Benz came up with such speed that I actually pushed my grandchild onto the pavement and jumped myself, and then he screamed abuse. At another age and in another time and another place, I would have taken him out of the car and dealt with him as he should be dealt with for screaming obscenities in front of little children. But that's the 'tolerance' of the people who oppose us in this debate: they try and throw the Bishop of Tasmania in jail; they scream abuse at us; they campaign against us. But that's all right. They can do that.  I didn't know a lot about this, and I was asked to speak. We addressed a meeting of about a thousand people in Brisbane. And, not knowing a great deal about it, I spoke about Christianity and the contribution that Christianity had made to the history of the world, from the abolition of communism, which killed more people than any other ism in human history, to the abolition of slavery, to the civilisation of the Roman empire. I spoke about all those things.  I listened in horror to the story of the two young mothers. The first one started off by saying: 'My son told me that he had to go to school tomorrow in a dress, and I said my boys will never, ever go in public in a dress. I rang up the headmaster of the school, and he more or less told me, 'It's the orders of the education department, and you'll send your kid to school in a dress. Then the second lady got up and she said, 'My son was told not only that he had to go to school in a dress'-that's messing with young people's heads on a major scale here-'but also that in his head he had to become a woman for the day.' Throughout history, in the range and breadth of human history, there is no precedent for this sort of rubbish taking place. Do we have rights over our children? Do you think seriously that the LGBT group are going to stop here? It may be funny to yell out in a pub, 'I'm going bush before it becomes compulsory,' but it's not quite so funny. You talk about equality. They wanted equality in the giving of blood. They said, 'We as homosexuals have a right to give blood,' so they did, and I think 72 children were injected with AIDS from the blood that was given. It was hushed up. It was amazing to me that it never got any publicity at all. I actually had to ring up to verify whether the newspaper report I'd read was correct. There were 724 AIDS cases in this country, and no-one ever brought up the fact all of those AIDS cases, apart from the poor little children who got it through blood transfusion-whatever figure it was-were either intravenous drug users or men participating in homosexual behaviour. There were only two out of 724 cases that claim they weren't, and the report noted that they were living with an at-risk person-in other words, a homosexual person. So there was no such thing as AIDS in this country except within that narrow group of intravenous drug users and people participating in that sort of behaviour.  I watched on television last night a murder case involving two people of that persuasion. When I came to the office today my chief of staff, who, I might add, voted yes, said, 'You'd better write'-so and so-'a card or something.' I said, 'What's that all about?' 'Oh,' she said, 'the son got murdered. He was in a homosexual relationship.' We all know about the Versace case. This was another case. There's no doubt there is a DNA thing there, and some people can handle it but a lot of people can't. And there is a very, very ugly side to this, where the curtain comes down and we're not allowed to talk about it.  Mr Deputy Speaker, there is an ultimate statement upon a race of people, and that is that they simply vanish from the gene pool. If you take out my cousin-brothers, the First Australians, and if you take out the migrant population in Australia-recent migrants-then we have the lowest birthrate on earth. We are a vanishing race. Bob Birrell, the demographer from Melbourne, wrote an article in which he said that the current population of Australia is 22 million and within 100 years the population of Australia will be 7,000. I thought, 'This is ridiculous!' I went down to check it in the library. He said that when 20 Australians die they're replaced by only 17 people, and if that happened five times over a century then we would go from 21 million or 22 million people-whatever it was at the time-down to seven million people. I don't know; you might be a member of the vanishing race. You'd better shut up because you will be shortly if I lose my temper. I finally conclude on this- "
