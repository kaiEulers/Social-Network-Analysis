35877,2013-03-18,Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012,Second Reading,Barry Haase,1,LP,Durack,4,2,0.4073089802990468,0.3813949274249567,0.11900000000000001,0.841,0.040999999999999995,0.9947,"In 2004, the coalition amended the Marriage Act 1961 to define in legislation the common understanding in our community of marriage-that is, the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life. The coalition continues to believe that the majority of the Australian community agree with that definition. This definition does not in any way seek to prevent or discourage people from entering into same-sex relationships but, rather, simply recognises marriage as one of the bedrock institutions of society, which is the basis for forming families and which is underpinned by tradition. The coalition will not support legislation that would alter the status of traditional marriage between a man and a woman.  The coalition in the past supported the passage of the government's same-sex reform legislation on the condition that nothing in its terms affected the status and centrality of traditional marriage between a man and a woman. We believe it is important to send this strong signal about the special status of marriage. The coalition continues to remain committed to these principles and will not support future legislation that would allow same-sex couples to marry in Australia. This is indeed a contentious issue but it is a contentious issue that is driven by a minority of the Australian population. The reality of the situation is simply this: that we are not all born the same. We are by our very nature possessing of personalities and physical traits. We are different, and it is up to good governance in our society to provide a framework for behaviour-a framework that broadly embraces what is acceptable on a day-to-day basis as being our culture.  One of the things, as I have just said, is that we accept that marriage has a sanctity. It is different to other relationships. It is covered by law, and that law defines that marriage condition as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life. If one wants to engage in a relationship that is not a relationship between a man and a woman, is not entered into voluntarily or is not for life then that relationship is not marriage. I for one, and the coalition at large, agrees that that is the situation and, no matter how hard we may wish it, those who are not a man and a woman-those who may be of the same sex in a relationship-cannot therefore at law refer to themselves as married. And why not? Because they are simply not a man and a woman. The sanctity of marriage that I speak of is such that when a couple court and marry, create a home and a loving environment, we hope that that will be rewarded with the production of children and those children will be brought up as members of our society. That is what we speak of when we speak of the sanctity of marriage, and that relationship, that union, ought to be respected at law by Australians. It is our culture. It is our law. It is a productive situation that is rational, that nurtures and provides the environment to nurture children and those children then become members of our society, responsible, law-abiding members of our society who will largely follow in the footsteps of their parents, we trust, and follow the laws of this country. I state again that the law of this country is that marriage is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life, and that law ought remain for time into the future.

35879,2013-03-18,Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012,Second Reading,Kelly O'Dwyer,0,LP,Higgins,1,5,0.17888337316138114,0.05424489315068369,0.134,0.809,0.057,0.9976,"Social attitudes are constantly and rapidly evolving-perhaps nowhere faster than in the area of marriage and relationships. But I am not sure that they are moving at such a pace as to justify the reintroduction of this bill, coming as it does only six months after this place last considered the issue. That said, debate on the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill was guillotined with unseemly haste. So it is opportune for me to make some small remarks on the issue now. In a volatile and rapidly changing world, committed, long-term monogamous relationships play a critical role in providing stability to couples and, in turn, their families and communities. Once this was provided almost exclusively through the institution of marriage but, over time, de facto or common-law relationships have become commonplace. The law views these in the same way as marriage, with the same rights, responsibilities and protections. However, only the institution of marriage provides for public declaration and promises sanctioned by the state. This, and society's longstanding appreciation of it and its solemnness, gives marriage its special place and power in our society. As with many areas of social change, this special place means we should tread warily. Change should be incremental rather than disruptive. Change should be well flagged, and sanctioned by the people, and it should be the subject of broad community consensus. Fifty percent plus one is not enough. Amongst other things, that means that, in this area, even more than in all other areas, we should abide by our commitments to the electorate.  In that regard, the coalition made a commitment before the last election that it would not support a change to the Marriage Act, and we continue to honour that commitment. In due course, I expect our policy on this area to evolve in step with society's views, and those views are complex. I have been moved by many of the discussions I have had with people from both sides of this debate. I reject absolutely the notion that those who favour the status quo are homophobic or ignorant. With limited exceptions, those whom I have met have presented cogent and considered arguments-sometimes, but not always, predicated on strong religious views. Equally, I reject absolutely the notion that those who favour change are radicals. I have met many people and the families of people in same-sex relationships who thoughtfully and powerfully presented their views and experience. For completeness, I should record that I have met some and received letters from some on both sides of the debate whose intolerance of views different from their own I found wholly unpersuasive and, frankly, ugly. To those people I would say: you do significant damage to the cause you seek to support.  Personally, I am comfortable with the idea of same-sex marriage. I am comfortable with it, for so many of the excellent reasons outlined by my colleague the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull MP in his Kirby oration last year. I do not propose to go through each one in turn, given the limited time available, but I do wish to make this point: families are the bedrock of our society. I stated this in my first speech three years ago, just as I also stated that families come in all shapes and sizes. I believe that changing the Marriage Act by extending the definition to include same-sex couples will not lessen the status of families. On the contrary, I think that it will strengthen it by building stronger bonds of commitment between two people regardless of gender and sexual orientation. There will be some people in my own family who will be disappointed with my personal position on the subject, because they have a sincere view that marriage is an institution between a man and woman. There will be others in my family, though, whose own ability to marry is predicated on such a change. In the end public life demands that we be true to ourselves and that we express our views in an honest and open manner no matter what the cost.  The coalition party room has not yet debated what our commitment will be on this issue in the upcoming election. There is one thing though on which there would be universal agreement: it is that with any change religious institutions such as churches, synagogues or mosques should not be forced by law to conduct same-sex marriages just as they are not forced to marry anyone today. Certainly this is my view. Naturally, this also highlights the distinction between the civil and religious institution of marriage and leads to the question of civil unions. Civil unions represent gradual and incremental change in a highly charged area. They facilitate statutory recognition of enduring relationships which do not currently exist at a federal level. There is clear broad based support for them. They would allow the community to take stock, build further community consensus and then consider whether to move to same-sex marriage just as it has taken place recently in the United Kingdom and almost all other countries that have legislated for same-sex marriage.  Unfortunately, this issue has been hijacked by one political party that prefers to use the issue as a political weapon to divide the community rather than achieve any real progress or outcomes. Hence we stand here today debating a bill that the parliament has already addressed rather than taking some steps forward. I think that is a shame."
35880,2013-03-18,Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012,Second Reading,Laura Smyth,0,ALP,La Trobe,2,5,0.12567642627936834,0.04696031888346322,0.07200000000000001,0.904,0.024,0.9837,"I am pleased to be able to make a contribution once again on the topic of marriage equality. It is a source of regret for me and I know for many people in my community of La Trobe who were unable to see success in the vote on the question of marriage equality which occurred earlier in this term; however, needless to say, it does not change the expectations I had when I last spoke on this issue, and those are that, ultimately, we will see change in this area just as we have seen substantial change in relation to marriage and the status of people within the institution of marriage over the previous decades.  It is important to recall that fact, because some in this debate will articulate the case that marriage has been unchanging and remained cast in stone for centuries. We only have to look at the last 100 years to see that marriage has changed considerably for women and Indigenous Australians. Australia agreed to be bound by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1980 and, in doing so, it recognised the importance of equality before the law and principles of nondiscrimination-and those are principles which those on this side of the chamber hold very dear. Many members of the Labor Party have advocated for reform to reflect principles of nondiscrimination in a range of legislative means.  After winning the 2007 federal election, Labor moved very swiftly to amend some 85 or so Commonwealth laws to remove discrimination on the basis of sexual preference, and it was entirely appropriate that we did so. Accordingly, it has been a source of great pride to me to see many members of the Labor Party campaigning around the issue of marriage equality. In that context, I would like to put on record my commendation for all those in Rainbow Labor who have endeavoured to progress this debate as far as they could during this term. I do not think that they will end their efforts. I said at the outset that this is simply one next stage in a long line of very important changes which have related to marriage and the status of married people in Australian society. I reflected on the role of women in marriage and their circumstances, and the role of Indigenous people and their capacity to seek to be married. Members may not be aware that, although women gained the right to vote in 1902, they could still lose their Australian nationality when they married a non-Australian national even as late as the 1940s. Before 1966, members will recall that many women had to resign from Public Service positions upon getting married. Though those things remained part of our system of law, at that time Australian society and Australian parliaments changed their views on those issues. Accordingly, I think there is the case and the capacity for change now in relation to the question of marriage equality for same-sex couples.  As I also reflected at the beginning of my remarks, Indigenous Australians did not necessarily have the right to marry a person of their own choosing as late as 1959. But that kind of discriminatory treatment in marriage changed after considerable struggle and considerable social change, including the 1967 referendum campaign. These are some of the changes that have occurred in relation to marriage. Indeed, we only have to reflect on the period around 1975 when we still had a fault-based system of divorce in this country. I know that some in this place may still want that to be the case, and I certainly disagree with that. And, fortunately, I know that many others also disagreed, with the effect that in 1975 we saw a much more humane approach to the already difficult decision to end a marriage.  So it is not the case, despite the suggestions of others in this place to the contrary, that marriage and all of the regulatory arrangements around it have remained fixed in stone. Accordingly, I think-as I thought in the earlier debate on marriage equality in this term-that there is a case for change, that change is inevitable, and I hope to see it in the next few years."
35878,2013-03-18,Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012,Second Reading,Graham Perrett,1,ALP,Moreton,1,11,0.13035023233245793,0.03291863565295304,0.16699999999999998,0.8190000000000001,0.013999999999999999,0.9988,"I am pleased to speak in support of the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012, because I believe that all Australians, irrespective of their sexuality, are entitled to be treated equally. Marriage is one of those institutions that has evolved over time. Despite the protestations of some people suggesting that it has been frozen in time and handed down from Mount Sinai, the reality is that previous speakers are quoting from legislation that has only been around less than a decade.  I approach this from a pretty basic point of view-that is, if people are committed to each other, if people are in love with each other, and wish to have society recognise that committed relationship, why should society not permit them to express that commitment via the institution of marriage? Obviously when it comes to religious institutions that is a different process, and the process of changing the views of religious institutions is something different. But we are a secular institution. We in parliament might start each day with a prayer, but we are a secular institution. Our Constitution provides for that. We also protect religions. Our Constitution provides for that. But we as a parliament must do what is best for all Australians, and how we can say to two people who are in love with each other that they cannot have a committed relationship recognised by an institution like parliament is beyond me. I should stress that this is not the No. 1 issue in the electorate of Moreton. There are cost-of-living issues, there are people concerned about employment, there are people concerned about making sure that their job is secure and there are people concerned about education, health and the like. I understand that, but I think we as a parliament have time to revisit this. I thank the member for Melbourne for reintroducing this legislation. He served on the committee that I chair which looked at this bill-a committee that had the greatest number of submissions in the history of Federation; a committee whose members had a broad range of views. I see in the chamber the member for Latrobe, who was also a part of that committee.  The reality is that, if the member for Warringah agrees tomorrow to let the members of his 'free-thinking Liberal Party' have a vote and this legislation was passed, it would not change anything in terms of how I see my wife tomorrow. It would not change anything in terms of how I approach my family, school et cetera. But it would let people who love each other and who are committed to each other have the protections of an institutional arrangement that society has recognised for hundreds and hundreds of years as being a good thing. The reality is that society has changed. Once upon a time, and not that long ago, homosexuality was in the DSM-the book used by psychologists in terms of approaching it as a treatable disease. Things have changed. It used to be in the Criminal Code in Queensland. Things have changed, though there is still some discrimination in Queensland in terms of the age of consent for homosexuals compared to heterosexuals. The reality is that most of society has moved on and recognised that same-sex attracted people deserve all the same rights, the same treatment and the same respect as every other person. This piece of legislation is an important step to ensuring that.  I would urge those opposite not to just stand up and say, 'I care' or 'I would if I could'. You can. If those opposite believe this then, unlike the people in the Labor Party, who are bound by our rules that say we cannot go against the directions of the Labor Party unless we wish to become an independent, they can stand up and protest and say, 'I would support it.' But caring is doing; caring with words is hollow. You need to show how you care by how you vote. So I will be interested to see if we are allowed to see the member for Wentworth and some of those other more liberal-thinking members of the coalition support this piece of sensible legislation. I urge them to so do."
36289,2013-05-27,Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012,Second Reading,Richard Marles,1,ALP,Corio,3,5,0.15775176499217874,0.040780632964342464,0.14800000000000002,0.825,0.027000000000000003,0.9985,"I rise to speak in favour of the member for Melbourne's bill, the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012, having previously spoken in favour of the member for Throsby's bill in relation to same-sex marriage. I start by saying that this issue represents the first conscience vote in which I have participated as a member of parliament, and I want to place on record, as I did previously, the wonderful way in which I believe this debate has been carried out in this parliament but also within my electorate. I have tried to make myself as available as possible to everyone, of all views, in relation to this issue-views which are deeply held. Really the way in which those views have been expressed to me, with a deep respect for people who hold different positions, stands in my view as a model for how debate should be conducted in this place. I want to make that very clear. I particularly want to say to those people who hold a different view to me in relation to this that the way in which they have engaged with me has always been with the utmost respectfulness and politeness.  An argument has been put to me-one that I have empathy for-that a number of churches in my electorate feel a concern that pressure will be created by virtue of the passage of this legislation, were it to occur, that would require them to conduct services in relation to same-sex couples, which they do not want to do. So in supporting same-sex marriage, as I do tonight, I do so very much with a renewed expression of the importance of the freedom of religious expression and the need for us all to defend that right. For me, this has been something of an unexpected journey in the course of this debate. There are many who feel that their rights to express their religious beliefs need defending within our community. So I very much say that for me, in supporting same-sex marriage in the context of this bill, the other side of that coin is a renewed commitment to defend the right of freedom of expression of churches, including those churches that would see marriage as being only between a man and a woman and would conduct marriage ceremonies only on that basis.  There has also been an argument put to me that allowing same-sex marriages represents the beginning of a slippery slope which will see other forms of relationship given legal sanction under our civil law. I do not agree with that argument. I do not see that we are putting ourselves on a slippery slope. In any event, all we can do in assessing this piece of legislation is to look at the proposition which is before us, which is about allowing the union of same-sex couples. In that sense, for me the arguments are very clear.  There were 85 separate pieces of legislation in the last parliament which were amended to remove discrimination against same-sex couples in the areas of property, superannuation and life insurance. This was a non-controversial step to take, and it removed discrimination across the board and was rightly regarded as an unambiguous good. I understand that for some marriage is seen as being deeply connected to the issue of faith, but for many others it is not. Marriage is first and foremost a statement between a couple of their commitment to each other and then a statement by that couple to their community and their friends about their commitment to each other. The ability to convey that to their community is part of the commitment that they make to each other. In my view, to deny a couple the opportunity to make that statement of their love to their community is for them a denial of a human right, and to remove the denial of that right is, in my view, just another removal of an act of discrimination, which we did without controversy in the last parliament. So it is for that reason that I think it is very important that we provide for same-sex marriage to be a part of our civil law so that people are able to make that commitment to themselves, to their friends, to their society and ultimately to their country and so that it can be recognised as such. In doing so, I very much defend the right of individual churches to conduct marriages as they see fit as an expression of their freedom of religion. "
36291,2013-05-27,Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012,Second Reading,Tanya Plibersek,0,ALP,Sydney,1,9,0.12749728458289986,0.02166515235672059,0.138,0.8220000000000001,0.04,0.997,"Last year I was proud to vote in support of the member for Throsby's private member's bill on marriage equality along with 37 of my Labor colleagues in the House of Representatives, three Independents and the member for Melbourne. I speak in support of his bill, the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 today.  Since last year's third we have seen the pace of change continue to quicken as laws reflect the aspiration for equality in our community. Maine, Maryland and Washington became the first US states to legalise marriage equality through a popular vote. The New Zealand parliament passed marriage equality in April this year, with observers and MPs breaking into a traditional Maori love song. France's National Assembly passed their 'marriage for all' bill despite death threats being sent to parliamentary supporters in a divisive national debate. As fast as laws across the world change, in Australia our parliament lags behind the community we represent. Many Australians remember a time when homosexuality was illegal and formal discrimination provided shelter for so many other acts of violence and bigotry against gay men and lesbians. The path to greater equality has been difficult, and at times has been halting as successive governments have worked to reduce the shadow cast by this kind of discrimination: from decriminalisation to protections against workplace discrimination to de facto relationship rights. I am proud of the role that the Labor Party has played in that journey, and the 85 laws which we changed in 2008 to remove discrimination against same-sex de facto couples. As complex as the task of removing discrimination can be, at its heart is one simple idea: that we should all be equal under the law. The conviction which drove us to amend those 85 laws discriminating against same-sex de facto couples should energise us now to complete the task ahead. Once we accept that heterosexual and same-sex couples should be equal before the law, how can we reserve marriage for one group and deny it to the other?  Marriage is both a religious and a civil institution. Other speakers have said that they would not expect churches to be forced to undertake marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples, and I agree that. Churches should not be forced to do that. But we are all members of a civil society as well. Many people enter the institution of marriage with no particular religious beliefs, but they still enjoy the rights and responsibilities that go with marriage. People often speak about the role of children in marriage, and as a married mother of three I know that marriage is a wonderful institution. But I have to say that I have gay and lesbian friends who have children too, and they would like to offer their children the security that marriage might bring to their relationship. There are also many couples who marry without ever intending to have children or, indeed, without being able to have children. They may marry later in life for the second or a third time, with no ability or intention to have children. Do we say that their marriages are worth less because they enter with no intention or ability to have children?  All Australians should have the right to legal recognition of their relationships and the advantages and responsibilities that such legal recognition brings with it. All Australians deserve the full social acceptance that removing discrimination symbolises. Often our attention is drawn by the battles in courts and parliaments around the world, but the measure of what is at stake is found in those places where marriage equality has been introduced. On those days when marriage equality becomes real you see men and women who have loved each other for decades surrounded by their friends and family making a declaration of their commitment to one another. You see the truth that same-sex couples are no less loving and their commitment to one another is no less moving or affirming. All they have been waiting for is for the law to acknowledge that.  I look forward to seeing those same scenes of love celebrated here in Australia."
36288,2013-05-27,Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012,Second Reading,Dennis Jensen,1,LP,Tangney,1,2,0.2689925328974578,0.20505002525928198,0.107,0.821,0.071,0.9875,"This bill, the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2013, is an attack on marriage. Marriage is not just a word but an institution, and institutions exist because there is a common need for them and they serve a common purpose. The bearing and rearing of children is the fundamental purpose of marriage. There are those that see marriage as a simple expression of love. It is that, but far more, and the far more is the reason that same-sex marriage does not make sense. There are many avenues that people can and do use to express love, devotion and commitment to each other. Marriage is one of those, but it is far more than that. Marriage is about family. To those that attempt Orwellian doublespeak in calling this 'marriage equality', I say: you already have marriage equality. Anyone-gay, bi, heterosexual-can marry a partner of the opposite sex. There is no discrimination here.  This bill is a piece of enabling legislation: it enables the dismantling of society as we know it. In essence, this bill is the apotheosis of a movement bent on legislating a social experiment. Gay marriage is a social experiment. Social experiments have poor results when viewed historically. One need only think of phrenology and eugenics, both of which, thankfully, have been consigned to the dustbins of history but not before having damaging social consequences. We have not yet seen the fallout from this social experiment where it has been undertaken in other jurisdictions. There simply has not been the time. Let us make haste slowly.  The poison of this bill is that it replaces absolutism with relativism. This leads to crises of confidence and moral drift. Moral drift has social and economic consequences. Certainty is the most precarious and most precious commodity in the world. The social experiment proposed here today is too risky. The biggest risk is the unknown effect of normalising and legalising these types of microsocial compacts. It all pivots on the unknown and unintended consequences. How can a child be brought into such a union? Certainly not as a natural result of that union. Is it not difficult enough to educate our children on reproduction facts without the added complication of a child with two mothers or two fathers? Yes, there are marriages where the relationship between the parents does damage the children. Yes, there are loving same-sex and single parents, just as with heterosexuals. But, just because bad parenting by natural parents can be pointed to, is that any reason to accept suboptimal parenting more generally? Clearly, all things being equal, it is preferable for a child to be raised by its natural parents, followed by a heterosexual adoptive couple. I can state, having my own children, that children need role models of both sexes, and it is far better that those role models are parents.  I now put forward the voices of the vast majority of the people of Tangney on the record for posterity. The following are arguments I have heard from my electors back in Perth: same-sex couples are not the optimal environment in which to raise children; gay marriage violates the sacred institution of marriage; same-sex marriage would threaten the institution of marriage; we shouldn't alter heterosexual marriage, which is a traditional institution that goes back to the dawn of time. What will we be debating next? It is incumbent on all members of this place to step back and seek the counsel of time and good sense. We must not cave in to popular trends or fancies. Are we leaders or followers? Only two decades ago or less, the same groups of people pushing for gay marriage today were decrying the institution of marriage as obsolete. So what has changed? There is no discrimination in the area of superannuation or life insurance for gay couples. Where would the next cut-off point be if this bill were to get up? These are the questions that gay marriage advocates cannot answer. Until such answers can be given to married people as to why they should accept such a fundamental change to their current status, I cannot as a representative of the people of Tangney support the member for Melbourne's bill.

36600,2013-06-03,Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012,Second Reading,Gai Brodtmann,0,ALP,Canberra,1,8,0.6551934025235402,0.6551934025235402,0.161,0.772,0.068,0.9971,"I rise tonight to reiterate my position on marriage equality, which I have spoken about before in this parliament. After much thought over many years, I am convinced the debate around marriage equality is fundamentally an argument about justice and that all people should be equal before the law. So, in good conscience, I have had no other choice than to support marriage equality.  Over the years I have honestly tried to weigh all the arguments in this debate. Many people try to convince me not to support marriage equality. In doing so, they have urged me to consider the children of same-sex unions. It caused me to reflect on my own family. I would have preferred that my father had not left my mother when I was 11. It was not my choice, it was not the choice of my sisters and it was certainly not the choice of my mother. It was the choice of my father. I bitterly resent and take deep offence at the suggestion that I was not raised in a family or that I am damaged or dysfunctional because I was raised by a single mother, because families come in many forms. Over the ages, children have been raised by aunts, by uncles, by grandparents, by siblings, by cousins, by friends, by benefactors, by the church, by the court, by nannies and by boarding schools. What is critical is that children in all circumstances are loved, respected, nurtured and safe. The construct of a family did not matter to me. The only thing I needed to know when I got home from school was that I had someone there to reassure me, to nurture me and to tell me that I was okay and that life was okay. Then there is the experience of my wider family. I am the proud godmother of Alice Rose Uhlmann-Foy. She is a precocious young girl with an unbridled passion for potato chips, and she is a girl well on her way to being Prime Minister. I find it impossible to believe that she could have more devoted parents than Elizabeth Uhlmann and Kate Foy. Both know that nothing is more nurturing than the love of family, and the world is a better place because Liz and Kate have two beautiful daughters, Alice Rose and Emma Kathleen. I cannot deny to them anything that I would wish for myself, and the best thing in my life is my marriage. My marriage stabilises me, energises me and constantly encourages me to be better than I am. Liz and Kate know that their life has not been an easy thing for some in our family to reconcile, but we all know that and we understand that, and we love them for it.  I have met with many, many constituents on this issue, and I have been struck by the strength and passion of both sides of the argument. For the most part, both sides have been deeply respectful. However, I have also been struck by the intolerance of a handful of people around this debate calling for tolerance. I have also been offended by the suggestion that those who do not support same-sex marriage are necessarily homophobic. The constituents I have met who are opposed to same-sex marriage are not homophobic. Like those who support it, they are driven by a deep faith and deep morality, and I respect that. But I respectfully disagree.  I call on all of my parliamentary colleagues and activists on both sides to maintain a respectful tone in this debate on this very important issue. It is, after all, a debate that is so deeply personal to so many. I am also firmly of the belief that no church should ever be forced to marry same-sex couples, and I will never support that. But the state already recognises unions like de facto couples that churches do not. Before the law of this Commonwealth, all women and men should be equal, no matter their colour, no matter their creed, no matter their sexual orientation, because people have the right to choose the individual they love, and, if they choose to marry, the state should not stand in their way. Strong relationships are the foundation on which we build a strong community."

I respect the fact that within my electorate there are a broad range of views on this issue, and I certainly respect the views of my constituents who might have a view different to my own. But as I have gone about my work-and I have met many people-it has merely served to confirm in my own mind that it would be the right thing to do to amend the Marriage Act to allow people of the same sex to marry. In saying that, I emphasise that I respect the views of those who disagree with me, and I have sought to represent them within my electorate and in this place, but I am firmly of the view that the Marriage Act should be changed-in fact, it will be changed one day; the only question is exactly when it will be changed.  I believe it must be changed for a number of reasons. For a start, you cannot outlaw love. I believe that two people, whether they be a man and a woman or two men or two women, if they love each other, are entitled to the same right to marry as any other couple. I also believe that the Marriage Act as it is currently worded and as it was amended by the Howard government is nothing short of legislated discrimination. This parliament has virtually ended legislated discrimination in a broad range of other acts of parliament, but it is remarkable that in this act the legislated discrimination remains, and I believe that that should be done away with. The way to do away with it is to do away with the requirement that a marriage be between a man and a woman. It should merely be between two people, and that includes two men or two women.  But, having said that, of course churches are private institutions, and they must be allowed to choose who they marry. I think it has been a very important component of the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 and of previous attempts to bring about marriage equality in this place that, when we do change the Marriage Act-and we will one day-it must be explicit that the churches retain the right to choose who they marry.  This is an issue where I think people should be allowed to follow their hearts, which means that it needs to be a conscience vote. It should be a conscience vote, and I remain very disappointed that the opposition is continuing to refuse to allow a conscience vote. I note that the tradition and the public statements from the Liberal Party make it quite explicit that it is a party that allows its members to follow their conscience on each and every vote. So it is remarkable that, on this matter, the opposition continues to refuse to allow the members of the Liberal Party to do what the Liberal Party has allowed in the past for many other issues, what the Liberal Party says that it is quite proud of, and that is to allow members to follow their conscience. One day they will be allowed to follow their conscience, and I think that will significantly alter the outcome of that vote at that time. This is not a personal attack on the Leader of the Opposition, but I do worry that, although it was famously said that he 'gets' women, I am not sure that he yet 'gets' gay people and their fundamental right to be able to choose who they love and to formalise that with a marriage under the Marriage Act. I call again on the opposition leader to do what his party says it allows and allow his members to follow their conscience and vote accordingly. Then we will know for sure what the genuine will of this parliament is on this issue. "

This is the third time that I have spoken on the issue of same-sex marriage. The first was on the member for Melbourne's notice of motion back in 2011 where we were called upon as members of parliament to consult with our communities. The second was on the member for Throsby's private members bill. Each time that I have spoken on this matter it has triggered an avalanche of correspondence in my electorate office.  I take up the point that the member for Denison just made with respect to a conscience vote. I think it is appropriate for members to have a conscience vote on this matter. In saying that, I must declare that I am coming into this debate with a strongly held personal view. My personal view is, and has always been, that marriage is between a man and a woman. I have been told that I am out of step with society and I have been accused of imposing my personal views on the community. It has also been said of me that I have been doing the bidding of the Catholic Church. I, like everybody else, can be influenced by my upbringing, but I have gone to some great length to ensure that I do not impose my personal views on my community. At one of the ALP conferences, as you would recall, Madam Speaker, where I think you and I both spoke, I got written up for having a view which was not necessarily popular. I got written up then as a vile, rotten politician. This is an issue of conscience and it should not be subject to politicking. It should not be subject to focus groups and surveys or influenced by external negotiations. It is your own personal position. If your views can be so easily affected by external forces, I think that says more about the person than anything about the subject matter that we are discussing.  Recently I was in a discussion with a very good friend of mine, Jim Marsden, a prominent solicitor in Campbelltown. Clearly he has a very strong view about marriage equality and is concerned that my view is out of step with the community. His late brother, John, was a leading solicitor, a champion of civil rights and a person associated with the contemporary developments of Campbelltown. He was a good friend of mine, like his brother, but John was gay. But that in no way affected my relationship with him or diminished my respect for him, his professionalism or the friendship that we shared. But I just cannot find it in me to apologise for the personal views that I hold. In this debate, I am challenged to put the community view ahead of my own beliefs. In accordance with the motion moved by the member for Melbourne back in 2011, I consulted with my electorate. I actually went to great lengths to do so. I received vast amounts of correspondence. I received four petitions; three of them had over 400 signatures each and the fourth had, from memory, 150 signatures. I conducted an online survey, as I know many other members did, and the feedback I received was overwhelming. I undertook the survey using the same basis that others members used; as a matter of fact, I think we all used the words that were in The Sydney Morning Herald to assess it. However, I got a vastly different result. There were 395 participants in the survey, and the responses demonstrated that in excess of 92 percent of my electorate were opposed to same-sex marriage. Because I reported it that way, the view was that my survey must have been doctored somehow, but I have no reason to do things like that.  My electorate is very multicultural, it is certainly socioeconomically challenged, and people with disabilities are overrepresented. But it also has a very strong and active, vibrant religious enclave. As I said, I will not come into this place and apologise for my own personal views, but I certainly will not come in here and apologise for the overwhelming view taken by my community. "
36603,2013-06-03,Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012,Second Reading,Alby Schultz,0,LP,Hume,4,9,0.1697935921335759,0.08841665401137801,0.08900000000000001,0.838,0.073,0.6294,"I rise for the fifth time to speak on a bill to amend the Marriage Act. At the outset, I would like to dispel the myth that members of the Liberal Party are unable to use their conscience vote. Unlike the Labor Party, we are, and I have used it on a number of occasions against my own party. We have the ability to vote with the other side of the parliament or abstain from voting. That is still available to people.  Having said that, I make the point once again: you have to admit that advocates for same-sex marriage are persistent. The member for Melbourne is certainly committed to the process of social engineering. The dogma to destroy the definition of marriage as defined in the Marriage Act is well and truly alive, and it will continue. He and his ilk arrogantly and continually ignore the wishes of the majority of Australians who, through their elected representatives, have emphatically said no to the recognition of same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage advocates like the member for Melbourne have placed new meaning on the Fabian Society's process of gradualism, or the drip, drip, drip process of social brainwashing. I quote from a succinct editorial on page 18 of The Weekend Australian of 29 May 2004, following the debate on the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 which resulted in significant recognition of the rights of homosexuals and reinforces the relentless self-indulgence of the homosexual movement's push for same-sex marriage, despite those generous reforms. The editorial began:  HOMOSEXUAL Australians had a big practical win and a small symbolic defeat this week The Government announced legislation to allow superannuation to pass to a same sex partner without penalty tax. It means that gay and lesbian partners will have the same rights as married couples and heterosexuals in de facto relationships. This is a long overdue and sensible decision that will put an end to a ridiculous restriction on the rights of homosexual couples. And I agree with that. It went on: The Government was accused of playing politics, seeking to shore up conservative support. But if this was the Prime Minister's motive it was one Labor was quick to share, saying it would support the legislation restricting marriage to heterosexuals. While gay activists might not like it, the major parties are convinced the community will not wear the idea of same sex marriage. And nothing has changed. The editorial also said:  Without this legislation, social engineers on the bench and at the bar would likely soon find some contrivance under international law that would bind Australia to acknowledge overseas same sex marriages and adoption rights. Mr Howard is quite right to say that if the definition of marriage is to change it should be done by the people's elected representatives, not the courts. Gays who argue this is demeaning and unjust should get over it. There is nothing that prevents priests and celebrants conducting ceremonies for gay couples affirming their decision to live as couples. They may not be married under the law but surely how they, and the people in their lives, perceive their relationship is what matters most. Fifty-one years ago, I married a wonderful woman in a marriage ceremony which was and is applicable to every Australian resident, without exception, today. The question needs to be asked: how are homosexuals discriminated against when no homosexual is denied marriage under Australian law and marital requirements are, without exception, applicable equally to every Australian resident? Isn't declining to accept marital rules a self-discriminating free choice and not a social or legal discrimination? De facto heterosexual couples are not discriminated against for choosing to refuse marriage, so what is the special obligation or need for homosexuals to marry? I close off by saying this: I think it is abominable that gay activists continue to focus on and manipulate civil rights strategies to justify claims for same-sex marriage and keep using accusations of discrimination, inequality and homophobia to intimidate politicians and the general public. I represent the majority of my constituents, who know and adhere to the reality that marriage is an accepted bond between a man and a woman. Marriage is a bedrock institution worthy of protection under law. There should be no doubt about what the word 'marriage' means. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that the commonly accepted definition of 'a union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others' is again under threat. In response to that, I say this: those who represent that threat will be out of this place in the next couple of months, but my views and the views of my family will not change in relation to the definition of marriage."
37064,2013-06-17,Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012,Second Reading,Greg Combet,1,ALP,Charlton,3,9,0.2874637317241213,0.18537723549481214,0.083,0.905,0.012,0.9914,"I rise to speak in support of the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 and I do so because I support the right of same-sex couples to marry. This bill amends the Marriage Act 1961 by amending the definition of marriage from 'husband and wife' to 'two people' and making consequential changes to give effect to that. Importantly, it does not oblige a minister of religion or a marriage celebrant to marry same-sex couples. On my view of it, this bill seeks to remove discrimination and to advance equality.  When we are considering this issue I think it is very important to look at it in a historical context, because marriage has undoubtedly changed over the years. We no longer have betrothals, dowries, a wife's vow of obedience or the prohibition on certain inter-race or religious marriage. Times change-that is a fact-and it is important that the legislature changes with them. Ending discrimination in this matter does not take away someone's rights; it in fact establishes equal rights for members of our community. Others in this debate, both here and overseas, have put that argument very eloquently. On the issue of the addressing of discrimination, Labor of course has a very proud history of fighting for rights and ending discrimination. It was Labor that established the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act. Labor has also acted in support of equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Australians. It was Labor in South Australia in 1975 that decriminalised homosexuality, and that was followed by Labor governments in New South Wales in 1984, Western Australia in 1990 and Queensland in 1991. In 1999, the New South Wales Labor government amended 20 pieces of legislation to provide same-sex partners the same rights as those enjoyed by de-facto heterosexual couples. The Victorian Labor government in 2000 outlawed discrimination on the basis of sexuality or gender identity. In 2001, the Western Australian Labor government provided same-sex couples rights around wills, estates and superannuation. Many state and territory governments have introduced relationship registers.  This federal Labor government has built on all of that record. In our first term in office, Labor amended 85 separate pieces of legislation to remove discrimination against same-sex couples. In this term of parliament we have allowed the issuing of certificates of non-impediment to same-sex couples wishing to marry overseas; we have extended the paid parental leave provisions to same-sex couples; and we have introduced the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill which will make it unlawful to discriminate against someone on the basis of their sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status, including in aged care. These are all important reforms.  In providing equality in relation to same-sex couples, Australia will not be acting on its own in the international community. When I spoke on this issue in debate on a similar bill last year, I advised the House that 10 countries and even more jurisdictions allow same-sex marriage. Since then, many more have acted, including France, our neighbours across the Tasman, in New Zealand, and many states in the United States of America. Like many members, in considering my approach to this issue, I have taken many points of view from amongst constituents I have consulted in relation to the issues, and I think it is fair to say that there are many strong and wide-ranging points of view about same-sex marriage. I respect those alternative views but, ultimately, for me as a member of parliament and as an individual, it is a matter of discrimination, in my view, against same-sex couples that I believe that the parliament should remedy. Same-sex couples should not be denied the right to marry.  As is the case for many other members, this issue is not only a matter of principle but also is personally relevant in the case of my own family, my extended family and amongst my friends. I cannot support continued discriminations against persons for whom I care very deeply and, as a parliamentarian, I think I have an obligation to make decisions based on not only personal values and issues of principle but also the importance of removing discrimination of this nature. We must make decisions in the interests of the constituents who elect us to this place, taking into account the wide range of views, having respect for them but ultimately ensuring that we do what we consider as parliamentarians to be the right thing.

It is 2012 and I wonder how long these bills hang around and why this one has not been brought to a vote-maybe it should have been settled in the same manner that the member for Throsby's bill was settled in the past.  As many speakers on my side have said in the past with regard to this matter, we had a position at the last federal election. We have a policy position that exists for the next federal election. We believe that it is important for Australians to know where we stand on things, to know that if they want to support us then they are getting a particular set of policies. The reality is that you are never going to make everybody happy with your policies and, ultimately, the voters in Australia will make their minds up as to what the really important issues are and what they would like to have but maybe cannot have. What I always say to people is: 'You know where we stand on this. This is the position we are taking to this federal election. We will not support a change in the definition of marriage.' We have been very clear on this. It was the case before the last election; it is the case for this coming election, so people know where we stand.  The government can shift its position and change the definition of marriage from being between a man and a woman. I know they have changed their position. What they said before the last election isn't what they ultimately decided to do. Obviously, that is always a point for them, and the government will be judged on changing their position again on this matter as with other matters. As I have said in the past, I have been approached by many people with regard to this issue. There are 95,000 voters in Cowan. People approach me-approach everyone-on a number of different issues. There is no doubt about that. I would never expect that we would find one issue where 95,000 people will express the same opinion. Despite what polls and newspapers might say, it is very hard to determine exactly what people believe on any particular issue. On this point, the issue of whether or not to change the definition of marriage, I say again that within Cowan, slightly fewer than 1,400 people expressed a view and made their views known to me at my office through emails. Of those, 178 out of the 95,000 have said that they would like a change in the definition of marriage. Almost, 1,119 have said that they believe the definition of marriage should stay unaltered: as between a man and a woman. That is their perspective from the Cowan electorate. I do not profess to say that I know the minds of every person in the electorate but, of those that felt the need to raise this issue with me and make their views known, it is quite clear.  In any case, as I have said before, the coalition has a party position on this. Of course, ultimately, members of the backbench have the right to exercise a conscience vote, if they wish to. I think what is now required is that this matter be dealt with in the same manner that the member for Throsby's bill was dealt with. Let us settle this matter once and for all and move on to issues that, according to the figures that I certainly have within the Cowan electorate, a lot more people are interested in. I look forward to this matter being concluded at the earliest opportunity."
37067,2013-06-17,Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012,Second Reading,Bernie Ripoll,1,ALP,Oxley,2,5,0.25933961502958397,0.15281264555005894,0.10099999999999999,0.862,0.037000000000000005,0.9937,"Firstly, I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012, which would change the Marriage Act 1961 to ensure that all people, regardless of their sex, sexual orientation or gender identity have the opportunity to marry. That is what this bill does. The bill also reverses a number of amendments made to the Marriage Act in 2004, which continues to recognise the basis of sexuality and gender identity, but this bill would prohibit the recognition of same-sex marriages entered into under the laws of another country. This is certainly an issue that has been brought forward by many people. The current situation is that the marriage overseas of same-sex couples is not recognised in this country. But the Australian government provides a certificate of no impediment to same-sex couples travelling overseas to get married. While we do not recognise it here in Australia, we certainly do not impede the ability of same-sex couples who choose to marry.  One of the important parts of the current law is that when those couples come back to Australia they are recognised as a de facto couple and are not discriminated against under the laws of this country in their legal rights or responsibilities. Labor is very proud of that. This is not a new debate. Labor are very proud of the fact that we have made something like 85 changes in law to make sure we do not discriminate against people. I am a big believer in that. I really believe that we should not discriminate against any person on the basis of their race, their gender, at their sexual orientation or anything else, including if a man and a man or a woman and a woman choose to marry.  This parliament has had a long history of conscience votes, and I think that is the right course of action on this issue. I would not force my view onto any other member of this parliament or any member of the community for that matter. I respect that people have different views in this area. Some are very deeply-held views-views that go to the people's personal moral beliefs, their ethical beliefs, their faith beliefs or just their views on how people ought to be treated in this country. But I do not take away from any individual their right to have those particular views nor any member of this chamber. I think the great strength of the Australian democracy is that these matters, particularly matters of conscience-and I think that this is one of them-come to this chamber and to this parliament, that we can have a sensible debate and that the view of the parliament can be carried and then we can we move on. That is one of the great strengths of our democracy, by any measure. There have been something like 30 conscience votes since 1950. When you think about it that is actually not a lot, given the tens of thousands of bills and things that are brought to this chamber. Very few have actually been a matter of conscience. During my time as a member, there have only been four: human cloning research, including use of embryos; RU486; and same-sex marriage. I took a principle stand on all of those, from the information that was presented to me at the time, from my own research, from consulting with my constituents, from my own belief structure and from my own views on what my vote should be-in the end, regardless of what people put forward to me as 'numbers', in the sense of, 'Does it slightly fall more one way, or slightly more the other way in what my constituents would think?' My own belief in that area is that you can never win if that is the way you operate. As a member of parliament, you are actually given a responsibility-that is, to act on your conscience, and to do that you need to be able to do that for the right reasons.  I do have to say, though, that my own view is that this parliament will at some point in time support same-sex marriage. I think same-sex marriage is not the thin end of the wedge in terms of other issues. I also do not believe same-sex marriage is a threat to the marriage of others, though some people think that by allowing same-sex marriage you threaten their marriage. Same-sex marriage is not a threat to children; there is no evidence to support that view. Same-sex marriage does not threaten the family. Same-sex marriage is not a threat to our way of life. Same-sex marriage is, as we know, legal in many countries, though not uniformly-some states have different views. I believe the community is changing its view as well because it is seen as being an issue of equity. If this bill does come to a vote, unlike my previous vote I will now be supporting this bill."
37066,2013-06-17,Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012,Second Reading,Stephen Smith,1,ALP,Perth,1,9,0.17299696892259547,0.08417165515638317,0.057999999999999996,0.924,0.017,0.9749,"I support the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012, as I did a comparable or similar bill, introduced by the member for Throsby into the House in September 2012, and I do so for the same reasons.  This bill was introduced by the member for Melbourne. I acknowledge his presence in the chamber and compliment him on his work and introduction of it. I take a contrary view to the previous speaker. I regard this matter as not a matter for party politics but a matter of conscience, an area where there are strong views firmly held. Those views are often based on religious beliefs and, as a consequence, I think this is an area where parliamentarians should form a view and exercise a conscience vote and I do so, again, on this occasion. This was not always my view. Between 2009 and 2011 I changed my view on this issue and I let that change of view be clearly known at the 2011 Australian Labor Party National Conference in December 2011 and reflected that view when I voted on the member for Throsby's bill in September last year. The essential reason for that view is that I do not see any reason why in a modern, tolerant Australia we should not make marriage available to same-sex couples. In my view, there is no reason why in a modern, tolerant Australia discrimination against same-sex couples should not be removed. That view is consistent with the approach that the Commonwealth parliament has taken over the years to marriage as an institution and I think it is worthwhile retracing those steps.  It was as late as early 1961 when this parliament enacted the Commonwealth Marriage Act, to make the institution of marriage subject to Commonwealth law. Previously, it had been dealt with by state law. That institutionalised marriage under Commonwealth law as a voluntary act entered into between a man and a woman. In 1975, under the Family Law Act, for the first time this parliament recognised that bona fide domestic relationships outside the institution of marriage gave them de jure recognition. So those people who entered into a bone fide domestic relationship, effectively, had the same entitlements at law as those in the institution of marriage reflected by and authorised by the Commonwealth Marriage Act 1961. That legislation gave men and women who, for whatever reason of their own, did not wish to enter into the institution of marriage not only comparable property and other rights if subsequently that bona fide domestic relationship came to an end but also rights as far as deceased estate and intestacy were concerned. At about the same time, from the mid to late 1970s through to the 1980s, both at the Commonwealth and state and territory level, we saw the introduction and passage of anti-discrimination legislation, which removed discrimination on the basis of sex, gender, sexual preference, religion or other areas. That had the effect of ensuring, ultimately through this parliament, through legislation presented and enacted by the then Commonwealth Attorney-General Robert McClelland, the removal of discrimination on the basis of same-sex couples, same-sex attitudes and same-sex approach, particularly in the case of superannuation. So we have seen, since the 1960s, a removal of the distinction between marriages recognised as being between a man and a woman under the Commonwealth Marriage Act; a relationship recognised by the 1975 Family Law Act, without a man and a woman entering into the institution of marriage; and then, both at state and Commonwealth levels, the removal of discrimination on the basis of sex or sexual preference through the 1970s and 1980s, culminating in the McClelland legislation, to which I have referred. At the same time, in state jurisdictions, in the 1970s and 1980s we saw the removal of criminal sanctions against homosexual male conduct or relationships.  In my view, in a modern and tolerant Australian society this is a logical next step to remove a discrimination, to remove an inequity and to remove and an unfairness. For the same reasons that I gave in the other chamber in September 2012, I support the bill in this chamber. "
