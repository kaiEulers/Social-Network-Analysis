Note: Section 88V is based on section 87 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. 88VA Contravention of Part VAA For the avoidance of doubt, conduct which is unlawful under Part VAA constitutes a contravention of Part VAA. Subdivision B-Jurisdiction of courts 88W Federal Court and Federal Circuit Court have jurisdiction For the purposes of this Division the Federal Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court have jurisdiction to hear and determine matters arising under Part VAA. (10) Schedule 1, page 16 (after line 8), after Part 1, insert: Part 1A-Amendment of the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 62A Subsection 3(1) (after paragraph (a) of the definition of unlawful discrimination )  Insert: (ab) Part VAA of the Marriage Act 1961; or 62B Subsection 3(1) (after paragraph (d) of the definition of unlawful discrimination ) Insert: (da) Division 2 of Part VAA of the Marriage Act 1961. (11) Schedule 1, item 70, page 20 (after line 13), after subitem (2), insert: (2A) Part VAA of the amended Act applies according to its terms from its commencement. These are important amendments because they seek to safeguard sincere Australians and entities that, for either conscientious or religion reasons, hold to a relevant marriage belief and directly associated beliefs on family structure, sexual relations and parenting. The amendments impose limitations on the expression of those marriage beliefs in that they must not constitute hate speech. They must not be harassing or threatening on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status or marital or relationship status. They do not give licence to sexual discrimination. They do not permit a person or entity to discriminate against other Australians, as prohibited under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. These amendments, rather, are a shield for people and organisations that hold to a traditional view of marriage. They are not a sword to be wielded in the service of bigotry. I make that very clear; they are a shield, not a sword. These protections are very narrow and tightly focused around marriage. The protections only operate around the question of marriage and directly associated beliefs as per the Marriage Act. They do not open the door, as some members of this House have suggested, to broader religious freedoms which are contrary to Australian values. This will not open the door to sharia law. I note the member for Isaacs is sitting opposite. We worked together closely on the committee for intelligence and security. He of all people knows that I'm not the sort of person who would seek to alloy Australian law with sharia law. This amendment is tightly focused on the question of marriage and safeguarding within limits the freedom of Australians and religious organisations who express a conviction in traditional marriage. It's very important that we safeguard those people and organisations now-not in the future, but today.  The member for Deakin's amendment to include a unifying definition of marriage that recognises the views of Australians who voted in the postal survey has just been voted down. We have effectively extinguished from the Marriage Act the view of marriage held by 4.9 million Australians. Now we must seek to protect their freedom to hold that view. When this bill passes, which it will, the practical effect of the legislation is that the rights of same-sex couples to marry will interact with the rights of those who hold a traditional view of marriage. We need to reconcile those rights in a way that protects all Australians without detriment to anyone acting in good conscience or from religious conviction with respect to marriage.  These amendments introduce part 5AA, which draws its constitutional basis from the external affairs powers under section 51 of the Constitution and the protection of religious and conscientious belief in international human rights law. It protects Australians in the following ways. First, it protects the freedom of Australians to hold or express a belief in traditional marriage without exposure to vexatious litigation under state or territory antivilification law. These protections will prevail against such laws with the Commonwealth providing a universal standard of protection for all Australians with respect to marriage. They will prevent instances like that we saw in Tasmania, where Archbishop Julian Porteous was hauled before the Anti-discrimination Tribunal. They would also protect people like the young Canberra woman who was fired in September for posting on her Facebook page, 'It's okay to say no.' Second, the amendments shield people and organisations such as churches, schools and faith based charities from detrimental treatment by government or delegated public authorities for expressing or holding traditional marriage beliefs. They will be able to hold their views without risk of dismissal, defunding, withdrawal of accreditation or any like detrimental action. Third, they protect people or organisations from having to promote or support views contrary to their own beliefs on marriage. They will protect people from coercion against conscience. Finally, and very importantly, they allow parents who hold to a traditional marriage and an associated view to withdraw their children from classes that teach material not consistent with their relevant beliefs. This protection mirrors the law that allows parent to withdraw their children from religious education. It is not novel; it reflects existing statute and case law here in Australia and New Zealand.  I want to come back to where I started. This amendment protects freedom of conscience and freedom of speech but within limitations. It does not licence hate speech or any speech that threatens or harasses those people of sexual orientation or views contrary to traditional marriage. It also provides a shield to organisations and individuals that is only enlivened when they're under attack. It's a good amendment, and I implore my colleagues to back it."
